The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove.

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nYou see an open fridge here. The fridge contains a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You see an oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . yellow bell pepper . yellow potato . directions . slice the parsley . roast the yellow bell pepper . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","bell pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","copy","recipe","slice","potato","yellow bell pepper","approach","yellow bell","yellow potato","tasty meal","meal","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","directions","slice the parsley","roast the yellow bell pepper","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  yellow bell pepper\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the parsley\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . yellow bell pepper . yellow potato . directions . slice the parsley . roast the yellow bell pepper . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","bell pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","copy","recipe","slice","potato","yellow bell pepper","approach","yellow bell","yellow potato","tasty meal","meal","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","directions","slice the parsley","roast the yellow bell pepper","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  yellow bell pepper\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the parsley\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","fridge","score","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","fridge","score","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
