Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. Classic TextWorld. You scan the room, seeing an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing is empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced parsley","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","parsley","sliced parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced parsley"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced parsley.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
