Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove.

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove.

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove.

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove.

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove.

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove.

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove.

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","score","red apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red apple from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red apple from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["onion","point","score","white onion","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["onion","point","score","white onion","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
