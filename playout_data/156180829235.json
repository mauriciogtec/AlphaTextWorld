An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove.

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove.

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove.

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water. You can see an oven. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a knife. You make out a counter. You see a chopped raw red potato, a banana, a red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
