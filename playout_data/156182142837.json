Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a yellow bell pepper , a white onion , a parsley and a

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.
