The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana and a red apple, so there's that. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted red onion , a chopped orange bell pepper , a cilantro , a yellow
