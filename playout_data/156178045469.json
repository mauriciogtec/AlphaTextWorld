Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried yellow potato, a red apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a banana and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one
