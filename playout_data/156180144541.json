A standard kind of place. Let's see what's in here.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge, so there's that. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven in the room. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
