You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a closed fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a closed oven. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. There is a closed sliding patio door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
