Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.

Because look over there, it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["bell pepper","recipe","tasty meal","rd ed","prepare meal","copy","yellow bell","modern approach","meal","reading","yellow bell pepper","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a pantry . an ordinary kind of place . you see a shelf . you shudder , but continue examining the shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["kind","ordinary kind","south","pantry","place","shelf","glass door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you arrive in a pantry","an ordinary kind of place","you see a shelf","you shudder , but continue examining the shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou arrive in a pantry.
