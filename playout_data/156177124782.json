Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. On the table you see a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Look over there! a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced fried banana and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","banana","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","inventory","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
