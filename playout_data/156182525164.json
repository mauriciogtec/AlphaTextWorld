You can make out a closed BBQ right there by you.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading north. There is an open wooden door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":18,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["go north","go south","go west"],"inputs":{"cmdlist":["go north","go south","go

You can make out a closed BBQ right there by you.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading north. There is an open wooden door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":18,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["go north"],"inputs":{"cmdlist":["go north"],"ents2id":{"approach":0,"open":1,"patio
