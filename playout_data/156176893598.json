You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . slice the banana . dice the parsley . chop the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["pepper","reading","tasty meal","meal","modern approach","banana","parsley","approach","copy","hot pepper","chop","slice","red hot pepper","prepare meal","rd ed","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","slice the banana","dice the parsley","chop the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  dice the parsley\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . slice the banana . dice the parsley . chop the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["pepper","reading","tasty meal","meal","modern approach","banana","parsley","approach","copy","hot pepper","chop","slice","red hot pepper","prepare meal","rd ed","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","slice the banana","dice the parsley","chop the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  dice the parsley\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true}]
