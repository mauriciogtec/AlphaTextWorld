Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge here. You make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter, so there's that. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced fried yellow bell pepper , some water , a diced parsley , a raw yellow potato , a red onion ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge here. You make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter, so there's that. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced fried yellow bell pepper , some water , a diced parsley , a raw yellow potato , a red onion ,
