Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou scan the room, seeing a patio chair. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! What's that over there? It looks like it's a BBQ. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.\n\nThere is an open wooden door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well ill be , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not . you see a fridge . you shudder , but continue examining the room . the fridge is empty . this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever . you see an oven . hmmm . what else , what else . you make out a table . the table is massive . on the table you can make out a knife . it doesnt get more textworld than this . you can make out a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a cookbook . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a stove . the stove is conventional . the stove appears to be empty . there is an open frosted - glass door leading east . there is an open screen door leading north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["place","door","hmmm","hey","counter","east","kitchen","mind","textworld","table","room","thing","stove","list","fridge","screen door","knife","exit","complete list","look","open screen door","oven","glass door","everything","cookbook","oh"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well ill be , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not","you see a fridge","you shudder , but continue examining the room","the fridge is empty","this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever","you see an oven","hmmm","what else , what else","you make out a table","the table is massive","on the table you can make out a knife","it doesnt get more textworld than this","you can make out a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a cookbook","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a stove","the stove is conventional","the stove appears to be empty","there is an open frosted - glass door leading east","there is an open screen door leading north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove.
