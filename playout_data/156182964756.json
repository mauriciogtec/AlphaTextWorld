Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nAh, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nAn open fridge is here. The fridge contains some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Classic TextWorld. You can see a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly counter, silly, empty, good for nothing counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nAh, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nAn open fridge is here. The fridge contains some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Classic TextWorld. You can see a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly counter, silly, empty, good for nothing counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nAh, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nAn open fridge is here. The fridge contains some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Classic TextWorld. You can see a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly counter, silly, empty, good for nothing counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . purple potato . yellow bell pepper . directions . dice the cilantro . chop the purple potato . fry the purple potato . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","reading","bell pepper","meal","rd ed","tasty meal","yellow bell pepper","prepare meal","approach","copy","cilantro","recipe","yellow bell","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","purple potato","yellow bell pepper","directions","dice the cilantro","chop the purple potato","fry the purple potato","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  purple potato\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the cilantro\n  chop the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . purple potato . yellow bell pepper . directions . dice the cilantro . chop the purple potato . fry the purple potato . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","reading","bell pepper","meal","rd ed","tasty meal","yellow bell pepper","prepare meal","approach","copy","cilantro","recipe","yellow bell","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","purple potato","yellow bell pepper","directions","dice the cilantro","chop the purple potato","fry the purple potato","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  purple potato\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the cilantro\n  chop the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . purple potato . yellow bell pepper . directions . dice the cilantro . chop the purple potato . fry the purple potato . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","reading","bell pepper","meal","rd ed","tasty meal","yellow bell pepper","prepare meal","approach","copy","cilantro","recipe","yellow bell","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","purple potato","yellow bell pepper","directions","dice the cilantro","chop the purple potato","fry the purple potato","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  purple potato\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the cilantro\n  chop the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
