If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook.

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and an orange bell pepper. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a sliced raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all
