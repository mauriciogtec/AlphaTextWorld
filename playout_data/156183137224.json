It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
