You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
