You can see a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion and a red onion","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","fridge","onion","white
