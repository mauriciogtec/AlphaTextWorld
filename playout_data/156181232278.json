Here's a fridge. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You see an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. You see a raw red potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a parsley"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a parsley.\n"},{"clean_text":"well ill be , you are in a place were calling a livingroom . were you looking for a sofa . because look over there , its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the west","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["exit","west","north","thing hasnt","sofa","door","look","livingroom","place","anything","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["well ill be , you are in a place were calling a livingroom","were you looking for a sofa","because look over there , its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nWell I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom.\n\nWere you looking for a sofa?

Here's a fridge. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You see an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. You see a raw red potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading west.

Here's a fridge. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You see an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. You see a raw red potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading west.

Here's a fridge. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You see an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. You see a raw red potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading west.
