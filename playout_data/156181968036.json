The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
