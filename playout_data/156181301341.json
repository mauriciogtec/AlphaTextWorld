You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see an opened fridge here. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a closed oven right there by you. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. On the counter you make out a raw red potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
