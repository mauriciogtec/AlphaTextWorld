Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a raw yellow potato and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a raw yellow potato and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a raw yellow potato and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a raw yellow potato and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a raw yellow potato and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a raw yellow potato and an orange bell

On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a raw yellow potato and an orange bell
