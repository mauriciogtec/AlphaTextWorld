An usual one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook banana with oven","cook banana with stove","examine cookbook","examine

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook banana with oven","cook banana with stove","examine cookbook","examine

An usual one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced fried banana","directions":null,"entities":["sliced fried banana","fried

An usual one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced fried banana","directions":null,"entities":["sliced fried banana","fried

An usual one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced fried banana","directions":null,"entities":["sliced fried banana","fried
