Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true}]
