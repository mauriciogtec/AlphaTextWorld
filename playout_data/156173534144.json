Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","entranceway","exit","youve","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","entranceway","exit","youve","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","entranceway","exit","youve","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","entranceway","exit","youve","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive.

You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive.

You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive.

You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?
