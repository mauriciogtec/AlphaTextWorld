You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a roasted orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a red hot pepper and a white
