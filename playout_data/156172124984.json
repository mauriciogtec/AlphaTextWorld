Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have fallen into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. Look over there! an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Fifty dollars?! That's ridiculous! You know, I know a person, they work out of city hall, who could get you one of those for 20 bucks! Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw yellow potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","counter","red apple","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red apple from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red apple from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","red hot pepper","hot pepper","chopped red hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","red hot pepper","hot pepper","chopped red hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","red hot pepper","hot pepper","chopped red hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the red apple . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["apple","point","red apple","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the red apple","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the red apple.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","red hot pepper","hot pepper","chopped red hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","red hot pepper","hot pepper","chopped red hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped red hot pepper.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
