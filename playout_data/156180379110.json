You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Huh, weird. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red hot pepper, a raw red potato and an orange bell pepper. You see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Huh, weird. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red hot pepper, a raw red potato and an orange bell pepper. You see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door?
