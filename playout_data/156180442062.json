You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a closed fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. You make out a closed oven nearby. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a raw purple potato and a raw red potato. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["chicken leg","block","raw chicken leg","fridge","cheese"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a block of cheese and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . purple potato . water . directions . slice the block of cheese . grill the block of cheese . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["water","slice","recipe","meal","block","approach","purple potato","copy","prepare meal","reading","cheese","tasty meal","modern approach","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","purple potato","water","directions","slice the block of cheese","grill the block of cheese","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  purple potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  grill the block of cheese\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in a backyard . the room is well lit . you make out a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . look over there . a patio table . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty . aw , and here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you can see a closed bbq . there is a closed wooden door leading south . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["look","door","bbq","south","sliding patio door","patio chair","room","closed wooden door","exit","open sliding patio door","closed bbq","wooden door","patio table","backyard","thing","aw","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["well , here we are in a backyard","the room is well lit","you make out a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","look over there","a patio table","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty","aw , and here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you can see a closed bbq","there is a closed wooden door leading south","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nWell, here we are in a backyard.
