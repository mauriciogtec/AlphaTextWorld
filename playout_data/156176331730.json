This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the room. Oh, great. Here's an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north.
