\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and some water. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a red apple, a banana and a knife. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and some water. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a red apple, a banana and a knife. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.
