A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio
