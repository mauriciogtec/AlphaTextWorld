Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains some water, a sliced block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a red apple and a raw red potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all
