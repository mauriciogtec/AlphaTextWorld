The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! You see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh!
