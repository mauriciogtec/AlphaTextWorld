As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is a closed patio door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is a closed patio door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is a closed patio door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
