You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north.

You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north.

You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north.
