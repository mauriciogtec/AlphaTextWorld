A typical kind of place.\n\nA closed fridge is in the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

A typical kind of place.\n\nA closed fridge is in the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
