You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . salt . white onion . directions . dice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["onion","approach","cilantro","modern approach","recipe","meal","prepare meal","white onion","tasty meal","salt","reading","rd ed","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","salt","white onion","directions","dice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  salt\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the plain door first","directions":null,"entities":["plain door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the plain door first"],"text":"You have to open the plain door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard one . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["east","door","corridor","one","standard one","north","dont worry","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard one","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . salt . white onion . directions . dice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["onion","approach","cilantro","modern approach","recipe","meal","prepare meal","white onion","tasty meal","salt","reading","rd ed","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","salt","white onion","directions","dice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  salt\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the plain door first","directions":null,"entities":["plain door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the plain door first"],"text":"You have to open the plain door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard one . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["east","door","corridor","one","standard one","north","dont worry","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard one","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . salt . white onion . directions . dice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["onion","approach","cilantro","modern approach","recipe","meal","prepare meal","white onion","tasty meal","salt","reading","rd ed","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","salt","white onion","directions","dice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  salt\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the plain door first","directions":null,"entities":["plain door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the plain door first"],"text":"You have to open the plain door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard one . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["east","door","corridor","one","standard one","north","dont worry","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard one","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.
