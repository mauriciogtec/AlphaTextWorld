You see a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

You see a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

You see a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

You see a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

You see a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the knife appears out of place
