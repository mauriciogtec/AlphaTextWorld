A standard one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. The fridge contains a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east.
