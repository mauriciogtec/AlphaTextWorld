Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, close by. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Classic TextWorld. You can see a table. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the table is an unstable piece of trash","directions":null,"entities":["piece","trash","table","unstable piece"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the table is an unstable piece of trash"],"text":"The table is an unstable piece of trash.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the table is an unstable piece of trash","directions":null,"entities":["piece","trash","table","unstable piece"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the table is an unstable piece of trash"],"text":"The table is an unstable piece of trash.\n\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true}]
