Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a yellow bell pepper , a white onion , a parsley and a

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a diced red apple, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a yellow bell pepper , a white onion , a parsley and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","chopped block","block","white onion","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","onion","cilantro","cheese","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a yellow bell pepper , a white onion , a parsley and a cilantro"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a chopped block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and a cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . red apple . directions . chop the block of cheese . dice the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","modern approach","block","copy","dice","cheese","rd ed","reading","recipe","tasty meal","red apple","apple","meal","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","red apple","directions","chop the block of cheese","dice the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . red apple . directions . chop the block of cheese . dice the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","modern approach","block","copy","dice","cheese","rd ed","reading","recipe","tasty meal","red apple","apple","meal","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","red apple","directions","chop the block of cheese","dice the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","apple","point","red apple","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red apple from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red apple from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","apple","point","red apple","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red apple from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red apple from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
