But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot

But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","pepper","hot
