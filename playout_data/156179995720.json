When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro! You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? You see a cookbook and a knife on the table, so there's that. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro! You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? You see a cookbook and a knife on the table, so there's that. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro! You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? You see a cookbook and a knife on the table, so there's that. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty
