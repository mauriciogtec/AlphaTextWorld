It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","fridge","cheese","block","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a block of cheese and a white onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . black pepper . block of cheese . flour . directions . slice the block of cheese . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","block","meal","recipe","pepper","flour","copy","reading","tasty meal","modern approach","approach","slice","prepare meal","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","black pepper","block of cheese","flour","directions","slice the block of cheese","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  black pepper\n  block of cheese\n  flour\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a standard kind of place . okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great . you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["standard kind","kind","door","entranceway","place","sickening smell","youre","thing","okay","sofa","everything","exit","livingroom"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a standard kind of place","okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great","you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","fridge","cheese","block","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a block of cheese and a white onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . black pepper . block of cheese . flour . directions . slice the block of cheese . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","block","meal","recipe","pepper","flour","copy","reading","tasty meal","modern approach","approach","slice","prepare meal","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","black pepper","block of cheese","flour","directions","slice the block of cheese","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  black pepper\n  block of cheese\n  flour\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a standard kind of place . okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great . you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["standard kind","kind","door","entranceway","place","sickening smell","youre","thing","okay","sofa","everything","exit","livingroom"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a standard kind of place","okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great","you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","fridge","cheese","block","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a block of cheese and a white onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . black pepper . block of cheese . flour . directions . slice the block of cheese . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","block","meal","recipe","pepper","flour","copy","reading","tasty meal","modern approach","approach","slice","prepare meal","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","black pepper","block of cheese","flour","directions","slice the block of cheese","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  black pepper\n  block of cheese\n  flour\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a standard kind of place . okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great . you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["standard kind","kind","door","entranceway","place","sickening smell","youre","thing","okay","sofa","everything","exit","livingroom"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a standard kind of place","okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great","you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","fridge","cheese","block","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese and a white onion"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a block of cheese and a white onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . black pepper . block of cheese . flour . directions . slice the block of cheese . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","block","meal","recipe","pepper","flour","copy","reading","tasty meal","modern approach","approach","slice","prepare meal","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","black pepper","block of cheese","flour","directions","slice the block of cheese","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  black pepper\n  block of cheese\n  flour\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a standard kind of place . okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great . you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["standard kind","kind","door","entranceway","place","sickening smell","youre","thing","okay","sofa","everything","exit","livingroom"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a standard kind of place","okay , just remember what youre here to do , and everything will go great","you smell a sickening smell , and follow it to a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.
