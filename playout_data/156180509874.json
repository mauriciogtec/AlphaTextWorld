On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a sliced white onion and a red onion. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven! You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
