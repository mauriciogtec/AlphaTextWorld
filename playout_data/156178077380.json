Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is close by. You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove appears to be empty.
