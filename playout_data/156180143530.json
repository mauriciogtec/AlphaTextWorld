A typical one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out an oven. You can see a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a raw pork chop and a red onion","directions":null,"entities":["raw pork chop","fridge","red onion","carrot","onion","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a raw pork chop and a red onion"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a carrot, a raw pork chop and a red onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red potato . directions . slice the carrot . chop the pork chop . fry the pork chop . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["copy","chop","dice","red potato","reading","modern approach","potato","approach","carrot","slice","prepare meal","rd ed","tasty meal","recipe","meal","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red potato","directions","slice the carrot","chop the pork chop","fry the pork chop","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  chop the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the livingroom . you see a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but there isnt a thing on it . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["exit","sofa","door","thing","livingroom","entranceway"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["well , here we are in the livingroom","you see a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but there isnt a thing on it","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nWell, here we are in the livingroom.\n\nYou see a sofa.
