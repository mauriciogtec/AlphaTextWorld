Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple

The fridge contains a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple

On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove.

You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove.

On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove.

You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . water . directions . slice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","rd ed","purple potato","copy","slice","water","recipe","approach","meal","prepare meal","tasty meal","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","water","directions","slice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["roasted purple potato","purple potato","recipe","sliced roasted purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced roasted purple potato.\n"},"level":9,"mainbranch":true}]
