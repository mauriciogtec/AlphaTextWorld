Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a raw red potato, a white onion and a yellow bell pepper. You can make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am stoked to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a raw red potato, a white onion and a yellow bell pepper. You can make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a raw red potato, a white onion and a yellow bell pepper. You can make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.
