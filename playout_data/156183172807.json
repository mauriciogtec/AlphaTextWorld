The fridge contains an orange bell pepper. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You make out a closed conventional looking oven in the corner. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you see a knife. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an open sliding patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
