The patio table is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look over there! a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a closed BBQ here.\n\nThere is an open barn door leading north. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"look around you . take it all in . its not every day someone gets to be in a shed . as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a toolbox . what a letdown . the toolbox is empty . you can see a workbench . the workbench is wooden . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . there is an open barn door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["toolbox","day someone","thing hasnt","aw","open barn door","anything","letdown","barn door","south","workbench","look"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"shed","sentences":["look around you","take it all in","its not every day someone gets to be in a shed","as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a toolbox","what a letdown","the toolbox is empty","you can see a workbench","the workbench is wooden","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","there is an open barn door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Shed =-\nLook around you.

The patio table is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look over there! a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a closed BBQ here.\n\nThere is an open barn door leading north. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"look around you . take it all in . its not every day someone gets to be in a shed . as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a toolbox . what a letdown . the toolbox is empty . you can see a workbench . the workbench is wooden . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . there is an open barn door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["toolbox","day someone","thing hasnt","aw","open barn door","anything","letdown","barn door","south","workbench","look"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"shed","sentences":["look around you","take it all in","its not every day someone gets to be in a shed","as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a toolbox","what a letdown","the toolbox is empty","you can see a workbench","the workbench is wooden","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","there is an open barn door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Shed =-\nLook around you.

The patio table is stylish. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Look over there! a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a closed BBQ here.\n\nThere is an open barn door leading north. There is an open sliding patio door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"look around you . take it all in . its not every day someone gets to be in a shed . as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a toolbox . what a letdown . the toolbox is empty . you can see a workbench . the workbench is wooden . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . there is an open barn door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["toolbox","day someone","thing hasnt","aw","open barn door","anything","letdown","barn door","south","workbench","look"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"shed","sentences":["look around you","take it all in","its not every day someone gets to be in a shed","as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a toolbox","what a letdown","the toolbox is empty","you can see a workbench","the workbench is wooden","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","there is an open barn door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Shed =-\nLook around you.
