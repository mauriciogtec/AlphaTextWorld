You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east.

Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a chopped fried yellow potato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east.

You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.
