Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a cilantro. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you can see a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
