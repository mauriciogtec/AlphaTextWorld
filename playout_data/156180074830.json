On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove.

On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove.

Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove.

There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a chopped white onion, a red onion and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a red apple. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
