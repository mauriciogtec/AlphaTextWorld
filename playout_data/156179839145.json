The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You see an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
