As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried
