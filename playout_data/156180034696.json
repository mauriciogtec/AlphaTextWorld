Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, some water and a black pepper. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven! Oh, great. Here's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
