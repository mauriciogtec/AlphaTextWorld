\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","purple potato","point","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","inventory","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","inventory","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
