You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors?

You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors?

You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing and a cilantro. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in a backyard . you can make out a patio chair . what a coincidence , werent you just thinking about a patio chair . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you see a patio table . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of junk . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you make out a bbq . there is an open wooden door leading south . there is an open screen door leading west . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["piece","exit","south","patio table","bbq","screen door","open screen door","east","coincidence","patio chair","textworld","everything","junk","open wooden door","door","west","werent","backyard","nothing","wooden door","dont worry","stuff","youre"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youre now in a backyard","you can make out a patio chair","what a coincidence , werent you just thinking about a patio chair","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you see a patio table","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of junk","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you make out a bbq","there is an open wooden door leading south","there is an open screen door leading west","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou're now in a backyard.\n\nYou can make out a patio chair.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing and a cilantro. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in a backyard . you can make out a patio chair . what a coincidence , werent you just thinking about a patio chair . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you see a patio table . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of junk . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you make out a bbq . there is an open wooden door leading south . there is an open screen door leading west . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["piece","exit","south","patio table","bbq","screen door","open screen door","east","coincidence","patio chair","textworld","everything","junk","open wooden door","door","west","werent","backyard","nothing","wooden door","dont worry","stuff","youre"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youre now in a backyard","you can make out a patio chair","what a coincidence , werent you just thinking about a patio chair","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you see a patio table","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of junk","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you make out a bbq","there is an open wooden door leading south","there is an open screen door leading west","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou're now in a backyard.\n\nYou can make out a patio chair.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing and a cilantro. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in a backyard . you can make out a patio chair . what a coincidence , werent you just thinking about a patio chair . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you see a patio table . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of junk . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you make out a bbq . there is an open wooden door leading south . there is an open screen door leading west . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["piece","exit","south","patio table","bbq","screen door","open screen door","east","coincidence","patio chair","textworld","everything","junk","open wooden door","door","west","werent","backyard","nothing","wooden door","dont worry","stuff","youre"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youre now in a backyard","you can make out a patio chair","what a coincidence , werent you just thinking about a patio chair","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you see a patio table","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of junk","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you make out a bbq","there is an open wooden door leading south","there is an open screen door leading west","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou're now in a backyard.\n\nYou can make out a patio chair.
