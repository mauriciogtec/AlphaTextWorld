\\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. On the counter you make out a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced fried block of cheese","directions":null,"entities":["cheese","diced fried block","fried
