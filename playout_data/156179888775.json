Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis just in- You, in the kitchen.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out an oven. You see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis just in- You, in the kitchen.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out an oven. You see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
