The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven here. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven here. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven here. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven here. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east.
