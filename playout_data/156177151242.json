Now why would someone leave that there? However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove.
