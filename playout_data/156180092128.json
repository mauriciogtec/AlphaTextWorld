hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one. The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one. The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one. The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one. The room is well lit.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a diced raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a knife on the table. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm.
