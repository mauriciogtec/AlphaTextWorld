You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
