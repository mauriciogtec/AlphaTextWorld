Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. A closed oven is close by. You can see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true}]
