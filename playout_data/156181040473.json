Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
