Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Backyard =-\nYou find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly patio table, silly, empty, good for nothing patio table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open wooden door","directions":null,"entities":["wooden door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open wooden door"],"text":"You open wooden door.\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in a place were calling a corridor . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["door","exit","north","west","dont worry","corridor","place","sliding patio door","east","open sliding patio door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well how about that , you are in a place were calling a corridor","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading west.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Backyard =-\nYou find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly patio table, silly, empty, good for nothing patio table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open wooden door","directions":null,"entities":["wooden door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open wooden door"],"text":"You open wooden door.\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in a place were calling a corridor . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["door","exit","north","west","dont worry","corridor","place","sliding patio door","east","open sliding patio door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well how about that , you are in a place were calling a corridor","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading west.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west.

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But there isn't a thing on it.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a closed BBQ, which looks recent, in the corner.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed wooden door leading west.
