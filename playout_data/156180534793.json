An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a banana and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
