Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped carrot , a block of cheese and some water","directions":null,"entities":["block","water","chopped carrot","cheese","carrot","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a chopped carrot , a block of cheese and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a chopped carrot, a block of cheese and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the carrot . slice the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","reading","meal","slice","recipe","copy","tasty meal","approach","hot pepper","carrot","pepper","rd ed","prepare meal","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the carrot","slice the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the carrot\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the carrot . slice the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","reading","meal","slice","recipe","copy","tasty meal","approach","hot pepper","carrot","pepper","rd ed","prepare meal","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the carrot","slice the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the carrot\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","carrot","score","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","point","hot pepper","score","pepper","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","meal","inventory","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","meal","inventory","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
