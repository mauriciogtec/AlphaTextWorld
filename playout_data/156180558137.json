Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains a fried pork chop and some water. You can see an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and
