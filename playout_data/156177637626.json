Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and a parsley. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped fried red potato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that diced roasted orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["roasted orange bell","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you couldnt pay me to eat that diced roasted orange bell pepper"],"text":"You couldn't pay me to eat that diced roasted orange bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . pork chop . red potato . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["slice","pork chop","prepare meal","reading","meal","red potato","approach","chop","potato","rd ed","modern approach","copy","tasty meal","orange bell","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","pork chop","red potato","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","orange bell","score","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the orange bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","orange bell","score","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the orange bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
