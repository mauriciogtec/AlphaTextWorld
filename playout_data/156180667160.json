You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
