Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou make out an open conventional looking fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You make out a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the carrot . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["carrot","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the carrot","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the carrot.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","inventory","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","inventory","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
