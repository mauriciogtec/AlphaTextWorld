The room is well lit.\n\nYou see a closed fridge, which looks conventional, in the room. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato and a cookbook. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading south. There is a closed plain door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one
