Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. You see a banana, a roasted red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. You see a banana, a roasted red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. You see a banana, a roasted red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a roasted pork chop"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a roasted pork chop.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . pork chop . red potato . directions . slice the banana . dice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","reading","slice","red potato","pork chop","banana","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","dice","potato","modern approach","recipe","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","pork chop","red potato","directions","slice the banana","dice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  dice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . pork chop . red potato . directions . slice the banana . dice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","reading","slice","red potato","pork chop","banana","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","dice","potato","modern approach","recipe","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","pork chop","red potato","directions","slice the banana","dice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  dice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","point","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","point","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
