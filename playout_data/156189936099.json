You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio chair in a room. You make out a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading south. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can make out a fridge . the fridge is empty , what a horrible day . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table . you see a cookbook on the table . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a stove . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["oh","everything","pretty fitting","name textworld","look","hm","fridge","east","corner","piece","open plain door","mind","place","hot pepper","exit","south","secret button","garbage","open sliding patio door","purple potato","day","button","horrible day","cookbook","room","text adventure","plain door","knife","oven","gleam","raw purple potato","sliding patio door","noise","nothing","wall","counter","table","pepper","kitchen","anything","red hot pepper","stove"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can make out a fridge","the fridge is empty , what a horrible day","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see an oven","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a table","you see a cookbook on the table","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you can make out a red hot pepper , a raw purple potato and a knife","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a stove","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button.
