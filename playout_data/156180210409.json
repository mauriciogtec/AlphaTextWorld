Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a closed fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a banana, a red apple, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato. You can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a red onion , a block of cheese , a carrot and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a closed fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a banana, a red apple, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato. You can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a red onion , a block of cheese , a carrot and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a closed fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a banana, a red apple, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato. You can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a red onion , a block of cheese , a carrot and some water","directions":null,"entities":["onion","raw pork chop","water","carrot","fridge","pork chop","block","cheese","red onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a red onion , a block of cheese , a carrot and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw pork chop, a red onion, a block of cheese, a carrot and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . pork chop . red apple . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","slice","red apple","recipe","meal","approach","pork chop","apple","banana","chop","reading","modern approach","prepare meal","tasty meal","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","pork chop","red apple","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . pork chop . red apple . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","slice","red apple","recipe","meal","approach","pork chop","apple","banana","chop","reading","modern approach","prepare meal","tasty meal","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","pork chop","red apple","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the pork chop . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the pork chop","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the pork chop.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you fried the pork chop . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the pork chop","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the pork chop.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
