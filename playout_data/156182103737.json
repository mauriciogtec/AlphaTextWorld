But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried red onion , a fried orange bell pepper , a red hot pepper , a raw red
