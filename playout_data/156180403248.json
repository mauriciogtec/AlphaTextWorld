Look over there, a fridge. You see an oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw pork chop , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a white onion , a cilantro , a parsley and some water","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","pork chop","onion","white onion","cilantro","fridge","fried yellow bell pepper","orange bell pepper","carrot","water","raw yellow potato","yellow potato","yellow bell pepper","raw pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a fried yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw pork chop , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a white onion , a cilantro , a parsley and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a fried yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a cilantro, a parsley and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red hot pepper . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the red hot pepper . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["copy","modern approach","hot pepper","bell pepper","slice","prepare meal","pepper","tasty meal","red hot pepper","recipe","chop","meal","yellow bell pepper","approach","yellow bell","reading","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red hot pepper","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the red hot pepper","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red hot pepper\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red hot pepper . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the red hot pepper . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["copy","modern approach","hot pepper","bell pepper","slice","prepare meal","pepper","tasty meal","red hot pepper","recipe","chop","meal","yellow bell pepper","approach","yellow bell","reading","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red hot pepper","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the red hot pepper","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red hot pepper\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","score","counter","pepper","red hot pepper","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","score","counter","pepper","red hot pepper","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
