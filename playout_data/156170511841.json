The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a red apple, a white onion, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a raw purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["raw purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a red apple, a white onion, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a red apple, a white onion, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nAn open conventional looking fridge is in the room. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a red apple, a white onion, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a raw purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["raw purple potato","purple

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nAn open conventional looking fridge is in the room. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a red apple, a white onion, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a raw purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["raw purple potato","purple

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nAn open conventional looking fridge is in the room. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a red apple, a white onion, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a raw purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["raw purple potato","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats a raw purple potato"],"text":"That's a raw purple potato!\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the raw pork chop looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":["raw pork chop","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the raw pork chop looks heavenly"],"text":"The raw pork chop looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the raw pork chop looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":["raw pork chop","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the raw pork chop looks heavenly"],"text":"The raw pork chop looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . red onion . directions . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","carrot","onion","rd ed","prepare meal","recipe","meal","copy","red onion","approach","modern approach","tasty meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","red onion","directions","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","fridge","carrot","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","fridge","carrot","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":7,"mainbranch":true}]
