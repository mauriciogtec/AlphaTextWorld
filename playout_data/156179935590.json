Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! A closed oven is right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.
