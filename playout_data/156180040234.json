Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table appears to be empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["north","livingroom","exit","thing","door","sofa","wow"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table appears to be empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["north","livingroom","exit","thing","door","sofa","wow"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table appears to be empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["north","livingroom","exit","thing","door","sofa","wow"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table appears to be empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["north","livingroom","exit","thing","door","sofa","wow"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table appears to be empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["north","livingroom","exit","thing","door","sofa","wow"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table appears to be empty. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["north","livingroom","exit","thing","door","sofa","wow"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!
