You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove!

Because look over there, it's a fridge. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You make out a table. You see a knife on the table, so there's that. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You make out a table. You see a knife on the table, so there's that. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried yellow potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove! But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork
