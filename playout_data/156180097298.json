Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, some water, a parsley, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a block of cheese, a red onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove.
