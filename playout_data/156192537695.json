Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a kitchen, but I guess I was wrong.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped orange bell pepper , a diced parsley , a chopped raw pork chop
