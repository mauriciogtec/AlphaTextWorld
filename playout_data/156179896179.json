You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a diced fried banana, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some water","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","bell pepper","water","carrot","cilantro","yellow bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . cilantro . red apple . directions . dice the banana . fry the banana . chop the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","apple","recipe","banana","tasty meal","approach","red apple","chop","modern approach","prepare meal","meal","cilantro","rd ed","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","cilantro","red apple","directions","dice the banana","fry the banana","chop the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  cilantro\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  dice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . cilantro . red apple . directions . dice the banana . fry the banana . chop the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","apple","recipe","banana","tasty meal","approach","red apple","chop","modern approach","prepare meal","meal","cilantro","rd ed","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","cilantro","red apple","directions","dice the banana","fry the banana","chop the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  cilantro\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  dice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","cilantro","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","cilantro","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
