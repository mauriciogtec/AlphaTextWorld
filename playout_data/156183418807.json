hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge contains some water, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.
