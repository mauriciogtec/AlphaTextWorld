On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell pepper","red onion","raw pork chop","onion","pepper","hot pepper","red hot pepper","white onion","pork chop","cilantro","fridge","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","diced red onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a cilantro"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . red onion . directions . dice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . dice the red onion . roast the red onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["dice","red onion","purple potato","recipe","onion","meal","approach","prepare meal","copy","tasty meal","reading","rd ed","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","red onion","directions","dice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","dice the red onion","roast the red onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  dice the red onion\n  roast the red onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . red onion . directions . dice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . dice the red onion . roast the red onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["dice","red onion","purple potato","recipe","onion","meal","approach","prepare meal","copy","tasty meal","reading","rd ed","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","red onion","directions","dice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","dice the red onion","roast the red onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  dice the red onion\n  roast the red onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","red onion","point","onion","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","red onion","point","onion","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
