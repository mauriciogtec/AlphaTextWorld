The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional.

The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
