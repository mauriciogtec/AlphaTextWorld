\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou make out an open fridge, which looks conventional, here. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and
