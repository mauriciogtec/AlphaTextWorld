It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a block of cheese and a carrot. You can make out an oven. You see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You see a knife on the counter. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east.
