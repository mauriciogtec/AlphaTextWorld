Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a block of cheese. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
