Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. The fridge contains a parsley, a roasted white onion and a red onion. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a closed oven here. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. The fridge contains a parsley, a roasted white onion and a red onion. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a closed oven here. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. The fridge contains a parsley, a roasted white onion and a red onion. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a closed oven here. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. The fridge contains a parsley, a roasted white onion and a red onion. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a closed oven here. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","counter","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . red potato . white onion . directions . slice the parsley . slice the red potato . roast the red potato . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","red potato","rd ed","onion","prepare meal","slice","white onion","meal","approach","potato","recipe","copy","tasty meal","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","red potato","white onion","directions","slice the parsley","slice the red potato","roast the red potato","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  red potato\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the parsley\n  slice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . red potato . white onion . directions . slice the parsley . slice the red potato . roast the red potato . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","red potato","rd ed","onion","prepare meal","slice","white onion","meal","approach","potato","recipe","copy","tasty meal","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","red potato","white onion","directions","slice the parsley","slice the red potato","roast the red potato","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  red potato\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the parsley\n  slice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
