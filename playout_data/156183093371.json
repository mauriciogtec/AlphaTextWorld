There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . orange bell pepper . purple potato . directions . slice the banana . fry the banana . chop the purple potato . fry the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","purple potato","modern approach","tasty meal","copy","orange bell","prepare meal","rd ed","slice","recipe","meal","reading","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","orange bell pepper","purple potato","directions","slice the banana","fry the banana","chop the purple potato","fry the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  orange bell pepper\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . orange bell pepper . purple potato . directions . slice the banana . fry the banana . chop the purple potato . fry the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","purple potato","modern approach","tasty meal","copy","orange bell","prepare meal","rd ed","slice","recipe","meal","reading","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","orange bell pepper","purple potato","directions","slice the banana","fry the banana","chop the purple potato","fry the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  orange bell pepper\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["banana","score","point","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","fridge","orange bell","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the orange bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","score","point","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
