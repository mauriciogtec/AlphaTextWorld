You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove.

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

\\$$$$$$$$ \\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a fried banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
