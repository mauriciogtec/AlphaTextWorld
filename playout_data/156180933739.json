No, this is a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a chopped carrot, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a counter. On the counter you can make out a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced banana, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

No, this is a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a chopped carrot, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a counter. On the counter you can make out a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced banana, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

No, this is a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a chopped carrot, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a counter. On the counter you can make out a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced banana, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

No, this is a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a chopped carrot, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion and some water. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a counter. On the counter you can make out a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced banana, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
