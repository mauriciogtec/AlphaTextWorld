Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried red apple, a raw red potato, a banana, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried red apple, a raw red potato, a banana, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried red apple, a raw red potato, a banana, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.

Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried red apple, a raw red potato, a banana, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried red apple, a raw red potato, a banana, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
