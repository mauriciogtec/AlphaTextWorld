Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am pleased to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, some water, a sliced raw pork chop, a white onion and a cilantro. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a counter! You see a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
