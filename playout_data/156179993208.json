You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some water","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","raw pork chop","block","onion","pork chop","white onion","cilantro","fridge","water","cheese","chopped white onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a block of cheese, a chopped white onion, a red onion, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . purple potato . white onion . directions . dice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . chop the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","recipe","block","meal","approach","cheese","copy","white onion","tasty meal","reading","onion","prepare meal","rd ed","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","purple potato","white onion","directions","dice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","chop the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  purple potato\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  chop the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . purple potato . white onion . directions . dice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . chop the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","recipe","block","meal","approach","cheese","copy","white onion","tasty meal","reading","onion","prepare meal","rd ed","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","purple potato","white onion","directions","dice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","chop the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  purple potato\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  chop the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","score","purple potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the purple potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","purple potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the purple potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the purple potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you fried the purple potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","purple potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the purple potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the purple potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
