You can see an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one
