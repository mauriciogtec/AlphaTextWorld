The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd
