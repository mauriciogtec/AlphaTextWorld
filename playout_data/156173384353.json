There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted yellow potato, a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato. Huh, weird. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted yellow potato, a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato. Huh, weird. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted yellow potato, a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato. Huh, weird. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh!

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a carrot, a cilantro and a parsley. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted yellow potato, a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato. Huh, weird. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh!
