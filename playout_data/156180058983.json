Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
