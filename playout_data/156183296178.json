Wow, check out the price tag that's still affixed to the fridge! Three hundred dollars! The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and some water, so there's that. You make out a closed oven in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional.

Wow, check out the price tag that's still affixed to the fridge! Three hundred dollars! The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and some water, so there's that. You make out a closed oven in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional.
