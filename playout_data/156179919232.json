Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a closed oven nearby. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You see a counter. You see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a parsley , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell pepper","white onion","fridge","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","parsley","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a parsley , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a parsley, a yellow bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a white onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . purple potato . directions . dice the parsley . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","reading","meal","copy","approach","modern approach","tasty meal","parsley","prepare meal","recipe","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","purple potato","directions","dice the parsley","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . purple potato . directions . dice the parsley . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","reading","meal","copy","approach","modern approach","tasty meal","parsley","prepare meal","recipe","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","purple potato","directions","dice the parsley","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","parsley","fridge","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced parsley","directions":null,"entities":["diced parsley","parsley","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced parsley"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced parsley.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
