Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors?
