However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the livingroom . you see a sofa . but there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["door","sofa","everything","livingroom","textworld","exit","thing","dont worry","stuff","east"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["well , here we are in the livingroom","you see a sofa","but there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nWell, here we are in the livingroom.\n\nYou see a sofa.

However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the livingroom . you see a sofa . but there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["door","sofa","everything","livingroom","textworld","exit","thing","dont worry","stuff","east"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["well , here we are in the livingroom","you see a sofa","but there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nWell, here we are in the livingroom.\n\nYou see a sofa.
