Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["diced white onion","water","parsley","onion","bell pepper","fridge","cilantro","yellow bell pepper","white onion","red onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced white onion , some water , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a cilantro and a parsley"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced white onion, some water, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a cilantro and a parsley.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red potato . water . white onion . directions . dice the red potato . fry the red potato . dice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["water","onion","potato","meal","prepare meal","rd ed","reading","modern approach","copy","recipe","tasty meal","dice","white onion","approach","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red potato","water","white onion","directions","dice the red potato","fry the red potato","dice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red potato\n  water\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  dice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red potato . water . white onion . directions . dice the red potato . fry the red potato . dice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["water","onion","potato","meal","prepare meal","rd ed","reading","modern approach","copy","recipe","tasty meal","dice","white onion","approach","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red potato","water","white onion","directions","dice the red potato","fry the red potato","dice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red potato\n  water\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  dice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["onion","fridge","point","white onion","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["onion","fridge","point","white onion","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
