The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried red apple"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried red apple.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried red apple"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried red apple.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried red apple"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried red apple.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried red apple"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried red apple.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red apple","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","fried red apple","diced fried red apple","apple","red apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried red apple"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried red apple.\n"},"level":19,"mainbranch":true}]
