You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a counter in a room. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","flour","tasty meal","prepare meal","approach","modern approach","water","rd ed","meal","copy","reading","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the patio door first","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the patio door first"],"text":"You have to open the patio door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the knife from the table","directions":null,"entities":["knife","table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the knife from the table"],"text":"You take the knife from the table.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open patio door"],"text":"You open patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["water","black pepper","fridge","pepper","orange bell pepper","chopped orange bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing some water, a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . an ordinary kind of place . there is an open fiberglass door leading west . there is an exit to the east . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["corridor","open fiberglass door","door","south","north","place","exit","kind","east","fiberglass door","west","ordinary kind","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","an ordinary kind of place","there is an open fiberglass door leading west","there is an exit to the east","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a counter in a room. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","flour","tasty meal","prepare meal","approach","modern approach","water","rd ed","meal","copy","reading","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the patio door first","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the patio door first"],"text":"You have to open the patio door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the knife from the table","directions":null,"entities":["knife","table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the knife from the table"],"text":"You take the knife from the table.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open patio door"],"text":"You open patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["water","black pepper","fridge","pepper","orange bell pepper","chopped orange bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing some water, a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . an ordinary kind of place . there is an open fiberglass door leading west . there is an exit to the east . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["corridor","open fiberglass door","door","south","north","place","exit","kind","east","fiberglass door","west","ordinary kind","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","an ordinary kind of place","there is an open fiberglass door leading west","there is an exit to the east","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a counter in a room. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","flour","tasty meal","prepare meal","approach","modern approach","water","rd ed","meal","copy","reading","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the patio door first","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the patio door first"],"text":"You have to open the patio door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the knife from the table","directions":null,"entities":["knife","table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the knife from the table"],"text":"You take the knife from the table.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open patio door"],"text":"You open patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["water","black pepper","fridge","pepper","orange bell pepper","chopped orange bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing some water, a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . an ordinary kind of place . there is an open fiberglass door leading west . there is an exit to the east . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["corridor","open fiberglass door","door","south","north","place","exit","kind","east","fiberglass door","west","ordinary kind","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","an ordinary kind of place","there is an open fiberglass door leading west","there is an exit to the east","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a counter in a room. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading south. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","flour","tasty meal","prepare meal","approach","modern approach","water","rd ed","meal","copy","reading","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the patio door first","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the patio door first"],"text":"You have to open the patio door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the knife from the table","directions":null,"entities":["knife","table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the knife from the table"],"text":"You take the knife from the table.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open patio door"],"text":"You open patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["water","black pepper","fridge","pepper","orange bell pepper","chopped orange bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing some water , a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing some water, a chopped orange bell pepper and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . an ordinary kind of place . there is an open fiberglass door leading west . there is an exit to the east . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["corridor","open fiberglass door","door","south","north","place","exit","kind","east","fiberglass door","west","ordinary kind","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","an ordinary kind of place","there is an open fiberglass door leading west","there is an exit to the east","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.
