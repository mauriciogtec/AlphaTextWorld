The fridge contains a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg. You can see an oven! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You see a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading north.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You see a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading north.
