Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis kitchen you have just entered is definitely typical. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper and a block of cheese. You make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried banana, a fried red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red apple . directions . dice the banana . fry the banana . dice the red apple . fry the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","dice","apple","rd ed","recipe","banana","copy","red apple","reading","meal","tasty meal","prepare meal","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red apple","directions","dice the banana","fry the banana","dice the red apple","fry the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  dice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  dice the red apple\n  fry the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red apple . directions . dice the banana . fry the banana . dice the red apple . fry the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","dice","apple","rd ed","recipe","banana","copy","red apple","reading","meal","tasty meal","prepare meal","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red apple","directions","dice the banana","fry the banana","dice the red apple","fry the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  dice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  dice the red apple\n  fry the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["potato","yellow potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the yellow potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red onion from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red onion from the fridge"],"text":"You take the red onion from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the yellow potato","directions":null,"entities":["potato","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the yellow potato"],"text":"You fried the yellow potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow potato.
