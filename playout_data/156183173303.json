Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you make out a knife. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a roasted banana, a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork chop","fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw pork chop and a parsley.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red potato . yellow potato . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . slice the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["dice","approach","prepare meal","copy","reading","tasty meal","meal","banana","potato","yellow potato","slice","red potato","modern approach","recipe","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red potato","yellow potato","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","slice the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red potato\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  slice the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red potato . yellow potato . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . slice the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["dice","approach","prepare meal","copy","reading","tasty meal","meal","banana","potato","yellow potato","slice","red potato","modern approach","recipe","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red potato","yellow potato","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","slice the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red potato\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  slice the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["banana","counter","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","score","potato","red potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","score","potato","red potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
