You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You check the price tag that hangs off the oven. 35 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a banana and a raw red potato. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley , some water and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["raw pork chop","yellow bell pepper","carrot","yellow potato","black pepper","bell pepper","pork chop","raw yellow potato","parsley","water","orange bell pepper","pepper","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a carrot , a raw yellow potato , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a parsley , some water and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a parsley, some water and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . carrot . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the banana . fry the banana . chop the yellow bell pepper . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["meal","rd ed","yellow bell pepper","modern approach","carrot","tasty meal","banana","recipe","bell pepper","reading","approach","prepare meal","yellow bell","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","carrot","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the banana","fry the banana","chop the yellow bell pepper","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  carrot\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . carrot . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the banana . fry the banana . chop the yellow bell pepper . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["meal","rd ed","yellow bell pepper","modern approach","carrot","tasty meal","banana","recipe","bell pepper","reading","approach","prepare meal","yellow bell","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","carrot","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the banana","fry the banana","chop the yellow bell pepper","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  carrot\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","point","score","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried banana","directions":null,"entities":["banana","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped fried banana"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped fried banana.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried banana","directions":null,"entities":["banana","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped fried banana"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped fried banana.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
