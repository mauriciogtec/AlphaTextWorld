You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors?
