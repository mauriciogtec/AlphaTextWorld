You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife. You can make out a stove! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.
