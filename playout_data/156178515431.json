However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange

Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a sliced fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cilantro. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a table! However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a roasted red hot pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a banana, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","fridge","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the orange bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","pepper","hot pepper","counter","score","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","pepper","hot pepper","counter","score","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
