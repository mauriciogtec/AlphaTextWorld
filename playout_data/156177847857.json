Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the table is durable","directions":null,"entities":["table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the table

On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the table is durable","directions":null,"entities":["table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the table is durable"],"text":"The table is durable.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you couldnt pay me to eat that orange bell pepper"],"text":"You couldn't pay me to eat that orange bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red onion . red potato . directions . dice the red onion . roast the red onion . slice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","recipe","dice","prepare meal","onion","slice","approach","copy","red onion","red potato","rd ed","tasty meal","potato","meal","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red onion","red potato","directions","dice the red onion","roast the red onion","slice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red onion\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the red onion\n  roast the red onion\n  slice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","red potato","score","potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","red potato","score","potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
