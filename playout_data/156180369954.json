A typical kind of place. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. A fridge... Is that really what you were looking for? The fridge contains a diced parsley and some water. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out an oven! Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You see a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

A typical kind of place. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. A fridge... Is that really what you were looking for? The fridge contains a diced parsley and some water. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out an oven! Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You see a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
