Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west"],"entities":["corridor","standard kind","technique","information","entranceway","place","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.
