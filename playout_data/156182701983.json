You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou see an open fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a block of cheese and some water. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
