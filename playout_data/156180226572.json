Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red onion. A closed oven is in the corner. You see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","copy","tasty meal","prepare meal","rd ed","potato","approach","recipe","meal","reading","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the livingroom . you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but there isnt a thing on it . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["south","west"],"entities":["hey","sofa","thing","exit","livingroom","noise","south","everything","room","list","anything","dont worry","youre","door","complete list"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youre now in the livingroom","you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but there isnt a thing on it","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou're now in the livingroom.
