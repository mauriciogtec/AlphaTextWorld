Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a sliced carrot, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a chopped raw yellow potato, a banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . yellow potato . directions . slice the carrot . fry the carrot . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","slice","rd ed","cilantro","yellow potato","prepare meal","meal","modern approach","potato","copy","carrot","tasty meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","yellow potato","directions","slice the carrot","fry the carrot","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . yellow potato . directions . slice the carrot . fry the carrot . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","slice","rd ed","cilantro","yellow potato","prepare meal","meal","modern approach","potato","copy","carrot","tasty meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","yellow potato","directions","slice the carrot","fry the carrot","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow potato","point","potato","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the yellow potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow potato","point","potato","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the yellow potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
