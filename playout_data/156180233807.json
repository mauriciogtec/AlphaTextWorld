The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You see a stove! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red onion . salt . water . directions . dice the red onion . fry the red onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","reading","rd ed","meal","prepare meal","copy","recipe","modern approach","tasty meal","salt","onion","water","dice","red onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red onion","salt","water","directions","dice the red onion","fry the red onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red onion\n  salt\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  dice the red onion\n  fry the red onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in a livingroom . you can see a sofa . does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions . unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . there is an open fiberglass door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["doesnt","anything","south","look","sofa","youre","exit","open fiberglass door","livingroom","fiberglass door","entranceway","thing","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youre now in a livingroom","you can see a sofa","does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions","unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","there is an open fiberglass door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou're now in a livingroom.\n\nYou can see a sofa.

This is some kind of backyard, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere.\n\nYou smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a patio table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio table? The patio table is stylish. But there isn't a thing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a patio table in a room. You can see a patio chair. But the thing is empty. You make out a BBQ!\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open barn door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well ill be , you are in the place were calling the kitchen . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you can see a fridge . the fridge contains some water . a closed oven is nearby . you make out a table . the table is massive . on the table you can see a knife . you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place . its pretty fitting . you scan the room for a counter , and you find a counter . on the counter you make out a cookbook . wow . just like in the movies . you see a stove . the stove is conventional . unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove . there is an open plain door leading east . there is an open screen door leading west . there is an exit to the south","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","fridge","cookbook","place","oven","information","open screen door","table","screen door","closed oven","room","stove","stuff","thing","counter","plain door","open plain door","wow","kitchen","exit","west","east","pretty fitting","technique","knife","water","name textworld"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well ill be , you are in the place were calling the kitchen","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you can see a fridge","the fridge contains some water","a closed oven is nearby","you make out a table","the table is massive","on the table you can see a knife","you idly wonder how they came up with the name textworld for this place","its pretty fitting","you scan the room for a counter , and you find a counter","on the counter you make out a cookbook","wow","just like in the movies","you see a stove","the stove is conventional","unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove","there is an open plain door leading east","there is an open screen door leading west","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.
