Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors?

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow!

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove?

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors?

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow!

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow!

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow!

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow!

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove?

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove?

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors?

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove?

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors?

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove?

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors?

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red potato, a chopped fried banana, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red potato . salt . directions . chop the banana . fry the banana . slice the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","potato","slice","copy","approach","recipe","reading","banana","red potato","prepare meal","meal","rd ed","tasty meal","salt"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red potato","salt","directions","chop the banana","fry the banana","slice the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red potato\n  salt\n\nDirections:\n  chop the banana\n  fry the banana\n  slice the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a red onion"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a red onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cookbook from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","cookbook"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cookbook from the counter"],"text":"You take the cookbook from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you drop the cookbook on the ground","directions":null,"entities":["ground","cookbook"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you drop the cookbook on the ground"],"text":"You drop the cookbook on the ground.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","potato","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the yellow potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["banana","score","point","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["banana","score","point","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
