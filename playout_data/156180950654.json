Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains some water. Classic TextWorld. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . water . directions . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","recipe","rd ed","tasty meal","water","prepare meal","meal","reading","approach","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","water","directions","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . water . directions . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","recipe","rd ed","tasty meal","water","prepare meal","meal","reading","approach","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","water","directions","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","water","score","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","inventory","score","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","inventory","score","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
