You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional.

Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional.

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional.

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . red onion . white onion . directions . dice the red onion . roast the red onion . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","onion","recipe","rd ed","tasty meal","meal","carrot","red onion","approach","white onion","dice","slice","prepare meal","copy","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","red onion","white onion","directions","dice the red onion","roast the red onion","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  red onion\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the red onion\n  roast the red onion\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . red onion . white onion . directions . dice the red onion . roast the red onion . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","onion","recipe","rd ed","tasty meal","meal","carrot","red onion","approach","white onion","dice","slice","prepare meal","copy","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","red onion","white onion","directions","dice the red onion","roast the red onion","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  red onion\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the red onion\n  roast the red onion\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","carrot","fridge","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced roasted red onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced roasted red onion.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced roasted red onion.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced roasted red onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced roasted red onion.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
