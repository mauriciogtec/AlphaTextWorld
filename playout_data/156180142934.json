The fridge contains a sliced raw pork chop. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is here. You can make out a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . purple potato . salt . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . dice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","pork chop","purple potato","rd ed","prepare meal","meal","modern approach","tasty meal","reading","recipe","salt","slice","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","purple potato","salt","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","dice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  purple potato\n  salt\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  dice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"if youre wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden , its because youve just shown up in the backyard . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you can see a patio chair . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . the patio chair is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . hm . oh well you see a patio table . you wonder idly who left that here . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . whats the point of an empty patio table . you make out a bbq . there is an open barn door leading north . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["dont","thing","longer","sliding patio door","patio table","empty patio table","south","dont worry","patio chair","point","text adventure","west","open sliding patio door","anything","backyard","youve","exit","bbq","barn door","hm","open barn door","room","youre","thing hasnt","door","everything","last longer","picture"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["if youre wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden , its because youve just shown up in the backyard","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you can see a patio chair","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","the patio chair is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","hm","oh well you see a patio table","you wonder idly who left that here","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","whats the point of an empty patio table","you make out a bbq","there is an open barn door leading north","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the backyard.
