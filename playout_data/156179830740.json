An usual kind of place.\n\nYou smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot, a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a white onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. A closed oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a fried red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . red apple . yellow bell pepper . directions . slice the carrot . roast the carrot . dice the red apple . fry the red apple . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["dice","meal","prepare meal","red apple","reading","copy","yellow bell","bell pepper","tasty meal","rd ed","recipe","yellow bell pepper","approach","modern approach","apple","carrot","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","red apple","yellow bell pepper","directions","slice the carrot","roast the carrot","dice the red apple","fry the red apple","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  red apple\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  roast the carrot\n  dice the red apple\n  fry the red apple\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a pantry . a normal kind of place . as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a shelf . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of trash . sometimes , just sometimes , textworld can just be the worst . there is an open frosted - glass door leading north","directions":["north"],"entities":["normal kind","trash","kind","pantry","nothing","textworld","shelf","glass door","piece","place"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you are in a pantry","a normal kind of place","as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a shelf","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of trash","sometimes , just sometimes , textworld can just be the worst","there is an open frosted - glass door leading north"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou are in a pantry.

An usual kind of place.\n\nYou smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot, a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a white onion, a cilantro and a black pepper. A closed oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a fried red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . red apple . yellow bell pepper . directions . slice the carrot . roast the carrot . dice the red apple . fry the red apple . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["dice","meal","prepare meal","red apple","reading","copy","yellow bell","bell pepper","tasty meal","rd ed","recipe","yellow bell pepper","approach","modern approach","apple","carrot","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","red apple","yellow bell pepper","directions","slice the carrot","roast the carrot","dice the red apple","fry the red apple","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  red apple\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  roast the carrot\n  dice the red apple\n  fry the red apple\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a pantry . a normal kind of place . as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a shelf . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of trash . sometimes , just sometimes , textworld can just be the worst . there is an open frosted - glass door leading north","directions":["north"],"entities":["normal kind","trash","kind","pantry","nothing","textworld","shelf","glass door","piece","place"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you are in a pantry","a normal kind of place","as if things werent amazing enough already , you can even see a shelf","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of trash","sometimes , just sometimes , textworld can just be the worst","there is an open frosted - glass door leading north"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou are in a pantry.
