You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see a closed conventional looking fridge in the room. You can see an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can see a counter. You see a sliced red hot pepper, a sliced red apple, a sliced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper on the counter. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , an orange bell pepper and some
