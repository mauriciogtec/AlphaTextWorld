Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a

You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a cookbook on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a
