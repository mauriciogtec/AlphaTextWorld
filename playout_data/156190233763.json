Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou see a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou see a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou see a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou see a closed fridge, which looks conventional, here. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
