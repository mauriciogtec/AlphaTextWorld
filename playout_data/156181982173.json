Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou make out an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a carrot. You make out a closed oven in the corner. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an open screen door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
