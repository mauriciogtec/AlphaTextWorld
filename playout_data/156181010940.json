A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional.

I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional.

A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","potato","reading","meal","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.
