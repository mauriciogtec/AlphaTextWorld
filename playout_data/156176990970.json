On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the cilantro looks savory","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the cilantro

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you see a banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.
