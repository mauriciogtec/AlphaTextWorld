Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . lets see whats in here . look over there . a patio chair . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the patio chair is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . you can make out a patio table . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq . now why would someone leave that there . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an open barn door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["someone","youre","door","stuff","patio table","corner","look","wow","barn door","open barn door","exit","gleam","open sliding patio door","thing","patio chair","sliding patio door","backyard","isnt textworld","south","textworld","bbq"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","lets see whats in here","look over there","a patio chair","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the patio chair is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","you can make out a patio table","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq","now why would someone leave that there","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an open barn door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . lets see whats in here . look over there . a patio chair . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the patio chair is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . you can make out a patio table . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq . now why would someone leave that there . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an open barn door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["someone","youre","door","stuff","patio table","corner","look","wow","barn door","open barn door","exit","gleam","open sliding patio door","thing","patio chair","sliding patio door","backyard","isnt textworld","south","textworld","bbq"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","lets see whats in here","look over there","a patio chair","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the patio chair is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","you can make out a patio table","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq","now why would someone leave that there","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an open barn door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . lets see whats in here . look over there . a patio chair . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the patio chair is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . you can make out a patio table . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq . now why would someone leave that there . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an open barn door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["someone","youre","door","stuff","patio table","corner","look","wow","barn door","open barn door","exit","gleam","open sliding patio door","thing","patio chair","sliding patio door","backyard","isnt textworld","south","textworld","bbq"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","lets see whats in here","look over there","a patio chair","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the patio chair is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","you can make out a patio table","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq","now why would someone leave that there","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an open barn door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . lets see whats in here . look over there . a patio chair . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the patio chair is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . you can make out a patio table . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq . now why would someone leave that there . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an open barn door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["someone","youre","door","stuff","patio table","corner","look","wow","barn door","open barn door","exit","gleam","open sliding patio door","thing","patio chair","sliding patio door","backyard","isnt textworld","south","textworld","bbq"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","lets see whats in here","look over there","a patio chair","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the patio chair is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","you can make out a patio table","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq","now why would someone leave that there","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an open barn door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . lets see whats in here . look over there . a patio chair . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the patio chair is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . you can make out a patio table . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq . now why would someone leave that there . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an open barn door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["someone","youre","door","stuff","patio table","corner","look","wow","barn door","open barn door","exit","gleam","open sliding patio door","thing","patio chair","sliding patio door","backyard","isnt textworld","south","textworld","bbq"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","lets see whats in here","look over there","a patio chair","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the patio chair is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","you can make out a patio table","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq","now why would someone leave that there","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an open barn door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . lets see whats in here . look over there . a patio chair . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the patio chair is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . you can make out a patio table . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld . the patio table is stylish . but the thing is empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq . now why would someone leave that there . there is an open sliding patio door leading north . there is an open barn door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["someone","youre","door","stuff","patio table","corner","look","wow","barn door","open barn door","exit","gleam","open sliding patio door","thing","patio chair","sliding patio door","backyard","isnt textworld","south","textworld","bbq"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","lets see whats in here","look over there","a patio chair","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the patio chair is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","you can make out a patio table","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a patio table , go to textworld","the patio table is stylish","but the thing is empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you see a gleam over in a corner , where you can see a bbq","now why would someone leave that there","there is an open sliding patio door leading north","there is an open barn door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.
