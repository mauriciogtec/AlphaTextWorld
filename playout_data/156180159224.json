The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOf every kitchen you could have shown up in, you had to saunter into a standard one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion and an orange bell pepper! You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOf every kitchen you could have shown up in, you had to saunter into a standard one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion and an orange bell pepper! You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOf every kitchen you could have shown up in, you had to saunter into a standard one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion and an orange bell pepper! You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOf every kitchen you could have shown up in, you had to saunter into a standard one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion and an orange bell pepper! You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOf every kitchen you could have shown up in, you had to saunter into a standard one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion and an orange bell pepper! You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
