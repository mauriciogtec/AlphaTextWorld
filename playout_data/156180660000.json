The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw red potato. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a block of cheese , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a parsley

The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw red potato. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Were you looking for a stove?

You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw red potato. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a block of cheese , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw red potato. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a block of cheese , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a parsley

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw red potato. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a block of cheese , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a parsley

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw red potato. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a block of cheese , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a parsley and some water","directions":null,"entities":["block","yellow bell pepper","raw pork chop","parsley","carrot","water","bell pepper","cheese","fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw pork chop , a block of cheese , a carrot , a yellow bell pepper , a parsley and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . directions . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","meal","prepare meal","purple potato","recipe","approach","tasty meal","copy","modern approach","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","directions","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . directions . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","meal","prepare meal","purple potato","recipe","approach","tasty meal","copy","modern approach","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","directions","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","score","point","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the purple potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the purple potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the purple potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the purple potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
