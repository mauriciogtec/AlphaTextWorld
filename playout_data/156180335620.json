Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven close by. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven close by. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven close by. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven close by. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven close by. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven close by. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
