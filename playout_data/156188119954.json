hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou make out an open fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all
