But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\nThere is a raw pork chop on the floor.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\nThere is a raw pork chop on the floor.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\nThere is a raw pork chop on the floor.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\nThere is a raw pork chop on the floor.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\nThere is a raw pork chop on the floor.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\nThere is a raw pork chop on the floor.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\nThere is a raw pork chop on the floor.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
