Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. You see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["chicken leg","raw chicken wing","fridge","raw chicken leg","chicken wing"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the frosted - glass door first","directions":null,"entities":["glass door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the frosted - glass door first"],"text":"You have to open the frosted-glass door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you begin looking for stuff . there is a closed sliding patio door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","west","closed sliding patio door","south","sliding patio door","stuff","north","corridor","youve","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you begin looking for stuff","there is a closed sliding patio door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. You see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["chicken leg","raw chicken wing","fridge","raw chicken leg","chicken wing"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the frosted - glass door first","directions":null,"entities":["glass door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the frosted - glass door first"],"text":"You have to open the frosted-glass door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you begin looking for stuff . there is a closed sliding patio door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","west","closed sliding patio door","south","sliding patio door","stuff","north","corridor","youve","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you begin looking for stuff","there is a closed sliding patio door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. You see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["chicken leg","raw chicken wing","fridge","raw chicken leg","chicken wing"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the frosted - glass door first","directions":null,"entities":["glass door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the frosted - glass door first"],"text":"You have to open the frosted-glass door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you begin looking for stuff . there is a closed sliding patio door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","west","closed sliding patio door","south","sliding patio door","stuff","north","corridor","youve","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you begin looking for stuff","there is a closed sliding patio door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. You see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["chicken leg","raw chicken wing","fridge","raw chicken leg","chicken wing"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the frosted - glass door first","directions":null,"entities":["glass door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the frosted - glass door first"],"text":"You have to open the frosted-glass door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you begin looking for stuff . there is a closed sliding patio door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","west","closed sliding patio door","south","sliding patio door","stuff","north","corridor","youve","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you begin looking for stuff","there is a closed sliding patio door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. You see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["chicken leg","raw chicken wing","fridge","raw chicken leg","chicken wing"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the frosted - glass door first","directions":null,"entities":["glass door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the frosted - glass door first"],"text":"You have to open the frosted-glass door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just shown up in a corridor . you begin looking for stuff . there is a closed sliding patio door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","west","closed sliding patio door","south","sliding patio door","stuff","north","corridor","youve","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve just shown up in a corridor","you begin looking for stuff","there is a closed sliding patio door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've just shown up in a corridor.

However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north.

However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the north.
