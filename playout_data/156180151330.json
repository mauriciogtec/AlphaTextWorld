Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . parsley . yellow potato . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the parsley . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","block","reading","copy","rd ed","modern approach","recipe","cheese","meal","yellow potato","approach","tasty meal","potato","slice","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","parsley","yellow potato","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the parsley","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  parsley\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the parsley\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . parsley . yellow potato . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the parsley . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","block","reading","copy","rd ed","modern approach","recipe","cheese","meal","yellow potato","approach","tasty meal","potato","slice","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","parsley","yellow potato","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the parsley","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  parsley\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the parsley\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the yellow potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["yellow potato","potato","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the yellow potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the yellow potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","score","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","score","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
