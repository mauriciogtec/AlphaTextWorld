Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the
