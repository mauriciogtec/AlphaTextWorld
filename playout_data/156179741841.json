You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. You don't like doors?

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a closed fridge. You see an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . directions . grill the carrot . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","rd ed","recipe","carrot","prepare meal","copy","approach","tasty meal","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","directions","grill the carrot","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n\nDirections:\n  grill the carrot\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open screen door","directions":null,"entities":["screen door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open screen door"],"text":"You open screen door.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","inventory","meal","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a corridor . an usual kind of place . there is an open fiberglass door leading north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["place","corridor","fiberglass door","dont worry","door","open fiberglass door","usual kind","south","kind","west","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you are in a corridor","an usual kind of place","there is an open fiberglass door leading north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou are in a corridor.
