The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from

The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["drop black pepper","drop olive oil","eat black pepper","examine cookbook","take banana from counter","take cilantro from
