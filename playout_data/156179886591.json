You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife, so there's that. You make out a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a banana, a raw red potato and a cookbook on the counter. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife, so there's that. You make out a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a banana, a raw red potato and a cookbook on the counter. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a banana, a raw red potato and a cookbook on the counter. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east.
