I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You make out a closed oven in the corner. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"guess what , you are in the place were calling the pantry . you can barely contain your excitement . oh , great . heres a shelf . the shelf is wooden . the shelf appears to be empty . hm . oh well . there is an open frosted - glass door leading north","directions":["north"],"entities":["shelf","glass door","hm","place","excitement","guess","pantry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["guess what , you are in the place were calling the pantry","you can barely contain your excitement","oh , great","heres a shelf","the shelf is wooden","the shelf appears to be empty","hm","oh well","there is an open frosted - glass door leading north"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nGuess what, you are in the place we're calling the pantry.
