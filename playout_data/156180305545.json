You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Huh, weird. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Huh, weird. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove! The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Huh, weird. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove! The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
