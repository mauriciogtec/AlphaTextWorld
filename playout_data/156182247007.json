The fridge contains a parsley. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . directions . slice the banana . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["slice","meal","tasty meal","modern approach","approach","prepare meal","banana","recipe","copy","rd ed","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","directions","slice the banana","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . directions . slice the banana . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["slice","meal","tasty meal","modern approach","approach","prepare meal","banana","recipe","copy","rd ed","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","directions","slice the banana","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the parsley . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the parsley","not bad"],"text":"You eat the parsley.
