Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a red onion, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

\\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You see an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a red onion, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced raw pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["diced raw pork chop","fridge","raw pork chop","pork

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You see an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a red onion, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced raw pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["diced raw pork chop","fridge","raw pork chop","pork
