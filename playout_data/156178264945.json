An ordinary kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You see a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

An ordinary kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You see a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one
