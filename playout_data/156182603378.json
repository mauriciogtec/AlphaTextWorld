You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove.

You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove.

You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove.

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Ninety bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You make out a closed oven nearby. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a red apple on the counter. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . red onion . directions . dice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . dice the red onion . roast the red onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","prepare meal","meal","modern approach","red onion","onion","approach","copy","recipe","rd ed","reading","tasty meal","dice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","red onion","directions","dice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","dice the red onion","roast the red onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  dice the red onion\n  roast the red onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","orange bell pepper","cilantro","red onion","white onion","onion","diced red onion","yellow bell pepper","fridge","pork chop","red hot pepper","raw pork chop","pepper","bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw pork chop , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a cilantro"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","point","score","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","onion","fridge","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","fried purple potato","diced fried purple potato","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried purple potato.\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the purple potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the purple potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the purple potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red onion . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","red onion","onion","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red onion","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the red onion.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","inventory","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","inventory","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":8,"mainbranch":true}]
