Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.
