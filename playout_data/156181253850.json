Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried banana, a fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
