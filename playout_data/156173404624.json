You see a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading north. You don't like doors?

You see a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading north. You don't like doors?
