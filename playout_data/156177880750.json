You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese, a sliced roasted white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.

You can make out an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the sliced roasted banana looks heavenly"],"text":"The sliced roasted banana looks heavenly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the block of cheese from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","score","block","cheese","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the block of cheese from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the block of cheese from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . white onion . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . dice the block of cheese . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","rd ed","copy","block","approach","tasty meal","cheese","meal","white onion","banana","slice","reading","recipe","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","white onion","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","dice the block of cheese","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  dice the block of cheese\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the yellow bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the yellow bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the yellow bell pepper.
