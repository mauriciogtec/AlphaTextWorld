Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven here. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
