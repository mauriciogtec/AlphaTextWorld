There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You can see a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You can see a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","orange bell pepper","cilantro","pepper","block","fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a block of cheese, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . orange bell pepper . parsley . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","cheese","modern approach","copy","recipe","slice","orange bell","approach","block","tasty meal","meal","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","orange bell pepper","parsley","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["youre","dont worry","door","corridor","east","south","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youre now in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou're now in the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","orange bell pepper","cilantro","pepper","block","fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a block of cheese, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . orange bell pepper . parsley . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","cheese","modern approach","copy","recipe","slice","orange bell","approach","block","tasty meal","meal","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","orange bell pepper","parsley","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["youre","dont worry","door","corridor","east","south","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youre now in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou're now in the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You can see a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","orange bell pepper","cilantro","pepper","block","fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a block of cheese, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . orange bell pepper . parsley . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","cheese","modern approach","copy","recipe","slice","orange bell","approach","block","tasty meal","meal","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","orange bell pepper","parsley","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["youre","dont worry","door","corridor","east","south","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youre now in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou're now in the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. You can see a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","cheese","orange bell pepper","cilantro","pepper","block","fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a parsley , a block of cheese , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a block of cheese, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . orange bell pepper . parsley . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","cheese","modern approach","copy","recipe","slice","orange bell","approach","block","tasty meal","meal","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","orange bell pepper","parsley","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["youre","dont worry","door","corridor","east","south","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youre now in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou're now in the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors?
