Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced roasted red apple, a red onion and a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?
