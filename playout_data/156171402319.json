Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just walked into a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . there is an open front door leading south . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["open front door","sofa","south","wow","dont worry","nothing","youve","garbage","front door","piece","door","exit","livingroom","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve just walked into a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","there is an open front door leading south","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've just walked into a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just walked into a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . there is an open front door leading south . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["open front door","sofa","south","wow","dont worry","nothing","youve","garbage","front door","piece","door","exit","livingroom","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve just walked into a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","there is an open front door leading south","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've just walked into a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just walked into a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . there is an open front door leading south . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["open front door","sofa","south","wow","dont worry","nothing","youve","garbage","front door","piece","door","exit","livingroom","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve just walked into a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","there is an open front door leading south","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've just walked into a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just walked into a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . there is an open front door leading south . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["open front door","sofa","south","wow","dont worry","nothing","youve","garbage","front door","piece","door","exit","livingroom","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve just walked into a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","there is an open front door leading south","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've just walked into a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nHey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

Look over there, a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh, great. Here's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just walked into a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . there is an open front door leading south . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["open front door","sofa","south","wow","dont worry","nothing","youve","garbage","front door","piece","door","exit","livingroom","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve just walked into a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","there is an open front door leading south","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've just walked into a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!

However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just walked into a livingroom . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but oh no . theres nothing on this piece of garbage . there is an open front door leading south . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["open front door","sofa","south","wow","dont worry","nothing","youve","garbage","front door","piece","door","exit","livingroom","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve just walked into a livingroom","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but oh no","theres nothing on this piece of garbage","there is an open front door leading south","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've just walked into a livingroom.\n\nOh wow!
