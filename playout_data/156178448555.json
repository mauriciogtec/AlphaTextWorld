Let's see what's in here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. You see a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook orange bell pepper with oven","cook orange bell pepper with stove","cook yellow

Let's see what's in here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. You see a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the yellow bell pepper . your score has just gone up by one

Let's see what's in here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. You see a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the yellow bell pepper . your score has just gone up by one

Let's see what's in here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. You see a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the yellow bell pepper . your score has just gone up by one

Let's see what's in here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. You see a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the yellow bell pepper . your score has just gone up by one

Let's see what's in here.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. You see a red hot pepper and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the yellow bell pepper . your score has just gone up by one
