The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted purple potato, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
