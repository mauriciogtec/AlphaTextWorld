Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water. You see an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water. You see an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water. You see an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water. You see an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water. You see an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water. You see an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water. You see an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north.
