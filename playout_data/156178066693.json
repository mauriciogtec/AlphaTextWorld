A normal kind of place.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge close by. You can make out a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you can make out a diced raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a raw red potato. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
