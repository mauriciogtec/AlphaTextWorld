\\$$$$$$$$ \\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nAh, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out an oven. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook on the counter. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted white onion and a red

Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook on the counter. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted white onion and a red

\\$$$$$$$$ \\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nAh, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out an oven. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook on the counter. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted white onion and a red
