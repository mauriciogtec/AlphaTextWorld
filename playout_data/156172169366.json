You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red

You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. You make out a closed oven in the room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried red onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","onion","red
