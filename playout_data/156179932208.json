Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou scan the room, seeing a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro and a block of cheese. You see a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook, so there's that. You can make out a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a chopped roasted red apple, a red onion and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
