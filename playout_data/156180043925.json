Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see a closed oven right there by you. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"ah , the livingroom . this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere . whats that over there . it looks like its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . the sofa appears to be empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west"],"entities":["west","atmosphere","oh","place","kind","livingroom","ah","ordinary atmosphere","exit","wonderful ordinary atmosphere","door","couldnt","dont worry","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["ah , the livingroom","this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere","whats that over there","it looks like its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","the sofa appears to be empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nAh, the livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see a closed oven right there by you. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"ah , the livingroom . this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere . whats that over there . it looks like its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . the sofa appears to be empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west"],"entities":["west","atmosphere","oh","place","kind","livingroom","ah","ordinary atmosphere","exit","wonderful ordinary atmosphere","door","couldnt","dont worry","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["ah , the livingroom","this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere","whats that over there","it looks like its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","the sofa appears to be empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nAh, the livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see a closed oven right there by you. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"ah , the livingroom . this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere . whats that over there . it looks like its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . the sofa appears to be empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west"],"entities":["west","atmosphere","oh","place","kind","livingroom","ah","ordinary atmosphere","exit","wonderful ordinary atmosphere","door","couldnt","dont worry","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["ah , the livingroom","this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere","whats that over there","it looks like its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","the sofa appears to be empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nAh, the livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see a closed oven right there by you. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"ah , the livingroom . this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere . whats that over there . it looks like its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . the sofa appears to be empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west"],"entities":["west","atmosphere","oh","place","kind","livingroom","ah","ordinary atmosphere","exit","wonderful ordinary atmosphere","door","couldnt","dont worry","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["ah , the livingroom","this is some kind of livingroom , really great ordinary vibes in this place , a wonderful ordinary atmosphere","whats that over there","it looks like its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","the sofa appears to be empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nAh, the livingroom.

Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove.
