You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for frying things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for frying things"],"text":"Useful for frying things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is solid . on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["potato","pepper","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper","counter","red hot pepper","yellow potato","red potato","chopped","hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is solid","on the counter are a sliced roasted red potato , a chopped roasted yellow potato , a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The counter is solid.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped roasted yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks well - built . you can see inside it . in the fridge is a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["built","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks well - built","you can see inside it","in the fridge is a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks well-built.
