What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven nearby. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Huh, weird. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
