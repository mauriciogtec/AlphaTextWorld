You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a closed oven right there by you. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a roasted red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato. You see a stove.
