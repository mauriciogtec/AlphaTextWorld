Look over there, a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains some water and a parsley. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a closed oven here. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

Look over there, a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains some water and a parsley. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a closed oven here. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

Look over there, a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains some water and a parsley. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a closed oven here. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh!
