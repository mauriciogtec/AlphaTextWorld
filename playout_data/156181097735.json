The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted carrot and a cilantro. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. You see a roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
