This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Oh, great. Here's an oven. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
