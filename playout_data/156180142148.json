The fridge contains a block of cheese and some water. You see an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty counter? You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading north. You need an exit without a door?
