You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nLook over there! a patio table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a patio chair. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You see a BBQ.\n\nThere is a closed wooden door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open wooden door","directions":null,"entities":["wooden door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open
