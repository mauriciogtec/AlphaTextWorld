The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has

The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has

The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","fridge","cilantro","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","onion","score","point","white onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","onion","score","point","white onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
