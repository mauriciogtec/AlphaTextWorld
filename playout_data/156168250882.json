On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. Huh, weird. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted white onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","diced roasted white onion","onion","white onion","roasted

A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven here. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. Huh, weird. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted white onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","diced roasted white onion","onion","white onion","roasted

A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven here. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. Huh, weird. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted white onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","diced roasted white onion","onion","white onion","roasted

A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see a closed conventional looking oven here. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. Huh, weird. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced roasted white onion","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","diced roasted white onion","onion","white onion","roasted
