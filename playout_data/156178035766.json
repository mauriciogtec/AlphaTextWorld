Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook red hot pepper with oven","cook red hot pepper with stove","cook red onion with oven","cook red onion with stove","cook red potato with

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook red hot pepper with oven","cook red hot pepper with stove","cook red onion with oven","cook red onion with stove","cook red potato with

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook red hot pepper with oven","cook red hot pepper with stove","cook red onion with oven","cook red onion with stove","cook red potato with

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook red hot pepper with oven","cook red hot pepper with stove","cook red onion with oven","cook red onion with stove","cook red potato with

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook red hot pepper with oven","cook red hot pepper with stove","cook red onion with oven","cook red onion with stove","cook red potato with

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook red hot pepper with oven","cook red hot pepper with stove","cook red onion with oven","cook red onion with stove","cook red potato with

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["cook red hot pepper with oven","cook red hot pepper with stove","cook red onion with oven","cook red onion with stove","cook red potato with

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true}]
