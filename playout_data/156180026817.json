On the counter you see a roasted yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a roasted yellow bell pepper , a red onion and an orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","yellow bell pepper","white onion","red onion","fridge","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a roasted yellow bell pepper , a red onion and an orange bell pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a white onion, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . white onion . yellow bell pepper . yellow potato . directions . slice the white onion . roast the yellow bell pepper . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","potato","yellow bell","slice","copy","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","white onion","meal","bell pepper","tasty meal","recipe","onion","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","white onion","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","directions","slice the white onion","roast the yellow bell pepper","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  white onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["kind","place","information","entranceway","technique","west","corridor","exit","south","door","standard kind","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you arrive in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou arrive in a corridor.

You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a roasted yellow bell pepper , a red onion and an orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","yellow bell pepper","white onion","red onion","fridge","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a roasted yellow bell pepper , a red onion and an orange bell pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a white onion, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . white onion . yellow bell pepper . yellow potato . directions . slice the white onion . roast the yellow bell pepper . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","potato","yellow bell","slice","copy","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","white onion","meal","bell pepper","tasty meal","recipe","onion","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","white onion","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","directions","slice the white onion","roast the yellow bell pepper","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  white onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["kind","place","information","entranceway","technique","west","corridor","exit","south","door","standard kind","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you arrive in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou arrive in a corridor.

On the counter you see a roasted yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a roasted yellow bell pepper , a red onion and an orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","yellow bell pepper","white onion","red onion","fridge","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , a roasted yellow bell pepper , a red onion and an orange bell pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a white onion, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . white onion . yellow bell pepper . yellow potato . directions . slice the white onion . roast the yellow bell pepper . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","potato","yellow bell","slice","copy","modern approach","rd ed","prepare meal","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","white onion","meal","bell pepper","tasty meal","recipe","onion","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","white onion","yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","directions","slice the white onion","roast the yellow bell pepper","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  white onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the white onion\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a corridor . a standard kind of place . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["kind","place","information","entranceway","technique","west","corridor","exit","south","door","standard kind","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you arrive in a corridor","a standard kind of place","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou arrive in a corridor.
