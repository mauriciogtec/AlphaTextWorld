Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a chopped red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper , a raw pork chop , a block of cheese and some
