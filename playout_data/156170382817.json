Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is here. Look over there! an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. You see a knife on the table, so there's that. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true}]
