Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced banana, a chopped raw red potato, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge here. The fridge contains a carrot. You make out an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced banana, a chopped raw red potato, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red potato . directions . slice the banana . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","potato","recipe","meal","prepare meal","tasty meal","banana","modern approach","red potato","copy","chop","slice","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red potato","directions","slice the banana","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red potato . directions . slice the banana . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","potato","recipe","meal","prepare meal","tasty meal","banana","modern approach","red potato","copy","chop","slice","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red potato","directions","slice the banana","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["potato","counter","score","point","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the red potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","score","potato","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the red potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the red potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","score","banana","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
