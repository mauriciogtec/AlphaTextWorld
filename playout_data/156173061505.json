The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nGuess what, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou see a closed fridge here. You make out an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. You see a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the table is an unstable piece of garbage . on the table is a cookbook","directions":null,"entities":["garbage","cookbook","unstable piece","piece","table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the table is an unstable piece of garbage","on the table is a cookbook"],"text":"The table is an unstable piece of garbage.\n\nOn the table is a cookbook.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw yellow potato , a red hot pepper , a cilantro and a parsley","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","cheese","block","raw yellow potato","red hot pepper","hot pepper","yellow bell pepper","cilantro","bell pepper","yellow potato","water","pepper","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing some water , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw yellow potato , a red hot pepper , a cilantro and a parsley"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing some water, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cilantro and a parsley.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","fridge","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . water . yellow bell pepper . directions . fry the block of cheese . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","cheese","block","approach","yellow bell","yellow bell pepper","rd ed","copy","tasty meal","recipe","bell pepper","water","reading","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","water","yellow bell pepper","directions","fry the block of cheese","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  water\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  fry the block of cheese\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . water . yellow bell pepper . directions . fry the block of cheese . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","cheese","block","approach","yellow bell","yellow bell pepper","rd ed","copy","tasty meal","recipe","bell pepper","water","reading","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","water","yellow bell pepper","directions","fry the block of cheese","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  water\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  fry the block of cheese\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
