Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a fried block of cheese, a white onion, some water, a red onion and a carrot. Classic TextWorld. You can make out an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the table you see a knife. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a fried block of cheese, a white onion, some water, a red onion and a carrot. Classic TextWorld. You can make out an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the table you see a knife. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a fried block of cheese, a white onion, some water, a red onion and a carrot. Classic TextWorld. You can make out an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the table you see a knife. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a fried block of cheese, a white onion, some water, a red onion and a carrot. Classic TextWorld. You can make out an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the table you see a knife. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can make out an open fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a fried block of cheese, a white onion, some water, a red onion and a carrot. Classic TextWorld. You can make out an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. On the table you see a knife. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Look over there! a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . water . white onion . directions . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","white onion","prepare meal","slice","block","copy","modern approach","onion","cheese","water","tasty meal","rd ed","reading","meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","water","white onion","directions","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  water\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . water . white onion . directions . fry the block of cheese . slice the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","white onion","prepare meal","slice","block","copy","modern approach","onion","cheese","water","tasty meal","rd ed","reading","meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","water","white onion","directions","fry the block of cheese","slice the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  water\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  fry the block of cheese\n  slice the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","water","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","water","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
