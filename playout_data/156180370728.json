Look over there, a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open screen door","directions":null,"entities":["screen door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open screen door"],"text":"You open screen door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted yellow bell pepper , a raw yellow potato , a red hot pepper and an orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","yellow potato","fridge","hot pepper","orange bell","raw yellow potato","pepper","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a roasted yellow bell pepper , a raw yellow potato , a red hot pepper and an orange bell pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper and an orange bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"okay , so youre in a backyard , cool , but is it typical . you better believe it is . whats that over there . it looks like its a patio chair . the patio chair appears to be empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . you make out a patio table . however , the patio table , like an empty patio table , has nothing on it . aw , and here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is a closed wooden door leading east . there is an open screen door leading south . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["east","cool","oh","couldnt","okay","patio table","patio chair","bbq","wooden door","nothing","closed bbq","north","closed wooden door","screen door","exit","youre","open screen door","empty patio table","south","backyard","aw"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["okay , so youre in a backyard , cool , but is it typical","you better believe it is","whats that over there","it looks like its a patio chair","the patio chair appears to be empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","you make out a patio table","however , the patio table , like an empty patio table , has nothing on it","aw , and here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is a closed wooden door leading east","there is an open screen door leading south","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nOkay, so you're in a backyard, cool, but is it typical?
