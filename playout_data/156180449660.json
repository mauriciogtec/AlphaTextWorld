You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you have to open the frosted - glass door first","directions":null,"entities":["glass door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you have to open the frosted - glass door first"],"text":"You have to open the frosted-glass door first.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a backyard . a standard one . i guess you better just go and list everything you see here . you can make out a patio chair . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . you scan the room for a patio table , and you find a patio table . now why would someone leave that there . the patio table is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a bbq . there is an open sliding patio door leading east . there is a closed wooden door leading north . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["standard one","patio chair","open sliding patio door","room","bbq","thing","east","patio table","backyard","sliding patio door","i guess","wow","everything","someone","one","wooden door","closed wooden door","entranceway"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you arrive in a backyard","a standard one","i guess you better just go and list everything you see here","you can make out a patio chair","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","you scan the room for a patio table , and you find a patio table","now why would someone leave that there","the patio table is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a bbq","there is an open sliding patio door leading east","there is a closed wooden door leading north","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou arrive in a backyard.

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. You don't like doors?

You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove.

You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove.

You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove.

You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove.

You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove.
