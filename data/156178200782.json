You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one
