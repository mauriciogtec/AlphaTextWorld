The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a raw yellow potato , a carrot , a white onion , a parsley and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","bell pepper","pepper","yellow potato","yellow bell pepper","carrot","parsley","black pepper","fridge","onion","raw yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a raw yellow potato , a carrot , a white onion , a parsley and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a white onion, a parsley and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . red hot pepper . yellow bell pepper . directions . slice the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","slice","recipe","meal","pepper","red hot pepper","bell pepper","flour","approach","yellow bell pepper","copy","prepare meal","reading","tasty meal","yellow bell","modern approach","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","red hot pepper","yellow bell pepper","directions","slice the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  red hot pepper\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a corridor . a typical kind of place . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north . there is an exit to the west","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["place","door","corridor","kind","exit","east","typical kind","dont worry","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you arrive in a corridor","a typical kind of place","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou arrive in a corridor.
