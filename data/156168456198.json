Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove.

You better believe it is.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

The fridge contains a diced block of cheese, a diced orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and a cilantro. You see a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!
