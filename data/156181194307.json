On the counter you can make out a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . olive oil . salt . white onion . directions . dice the white onion . fry the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","oil","onion","olive oil","recipe","meal","approach","reading","modern approach","salt","tasty meal","copy","white onion","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","olive oil","salt","white onion","directions","dice the white onion","fry the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  olive oil\n  salt\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the white onion\n  fry the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve stumbled into a standard room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . you begin looking for stuff . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["youre","youve","standard room","course","entranceway","stuff","mind","corridor","kind","room"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve stumbled into a standard room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","you begin looking for stuff","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've stumbled into a standard room.

On the counter you can make out a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . olive oil . salt . white onion . directions . dice the white onion . fry the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","oil","onion","olive oil","recipe","meal","approach","reading","modern approach","salt","tasty meal","copy","white onion","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","olive oil","salt","white onion","directions","dice the white onion","fry the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  olive oil\n  salt\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the white onion\n  fry the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve stumbled into a standard room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . you begin looking for stuff . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["youre","youve","standard room","course","entranceway","stuff","mind","corridor","kind","room"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve stumbled into a standard room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","you begin looking for stuff","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've stumbled into a standard room.
