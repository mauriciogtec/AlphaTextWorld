The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple

The fridge contains a grilled chicken leg and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["diced fried purple potato","fried purple potato","purple
