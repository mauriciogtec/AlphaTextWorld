Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","counter","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","counter","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
