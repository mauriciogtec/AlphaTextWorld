Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You see an oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","raw chicken leg","cilantro","diced cilantro","chicken leg"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . red potato . directions . slice the carrot . roast the carrot . dice the cilantro . slice the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["copy","potato","modern approach","red potato","carrot","slice","rd ed","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","cilantro","recipe","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","red potato","directions","slice the carrot","roast the carrot","dice the cilantro","slice the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  roast the carrot\n  dice the cilantro\n  slice the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin to take stock of whats in the room . whats that over there . it looks like its a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . the patio chair appears to be empty . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a patio table . you wonder idly who left that here . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you can make out a closed bbq in the corner . there is a closed barn door leading south . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["stock","thing","north","wow","patio table","exit","closed bbq","barn door","corner","closed barn door","backyard","sliding patio door","open sliding patio door","south","west","patio chair","room","bbq","aw"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin to take stock of whats in the room","whats that over there","it looks like its a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","the patio chair appears to be empty","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a patio table","you wonder idly who left that here","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you can make out a closed bbq in the corner","there is a closed barn door leading south","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You see an oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","raw chicken leg","cilantro","diced cilantro","chicken leg"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . red potato . directions . slice the carrot . roast the carrot . dice the cilantro . slice the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["copy","potato","modern approach","red potato","carrot","slice","rd ed","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","cilantro","recipe","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","red potato","directions","slice the carrot","roast the carrot","dice the cilantro","slice the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  roast the carrot\n  dice the cilantro\n  slice the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin to take stock of whats in the room . whats that over there . it looks like its a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . the patio chair appears to be empty . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a patio table . you wonder idly who left that here . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you can make out a closed bbq in the corner . there is a closed barn door leading south . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["stock","thing","north","wow","patio table","exit","closed bbq","barn door","corner","closed barn door","backyard","sliding patio door","open sliding patio door","south","west","patio chair","room","bbq","aw"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin to take stock of whats in the room","whats that over there","it looks like its a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","the patio chair appears to be empty","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a patio table","you wonder idly who left that here","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you can make out a closed bbq in the corner","there is a closed barn door leading south","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You see an oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","raw chicken leg","cilantro","diced cilantro","chicken leg"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . red potato . directions . slice the carrot . roast the carrot . dice the cilantro . slice the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["copy","potato","modern approach","red potato","carrot","slice","rd ed","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","cilantro","recipe","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","red potato","directions","slice the carrot","roast the carrot","dice the cilantro","slice the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  roast the carrot\n  dice the cilantro\n  slice the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin to take stock of whats in the room . whats that over there . it looks like its a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . the patio chair appears to be empty . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a patio table . you wonder idly who left that here . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you can make out a closed bbq in the corner . there is a closed barn door leading south . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["stock","thing","north","wow","patio table","exit","closed bbq","barn door","corner","closed barn door","backyard","sliding patio door","open sliding patio door","south","west","patio chair","room","bbq","aw"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin to take stock of whats in the room","whats that over there","it looks like its a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","the patio chair appears to be empty","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a patio table","you wonder idly who left that here","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you can make out a closed bbq in the corner","there is a closed barn door leading south","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You see an oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Hmmm... what else, what else? You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","raw chicken leg","cilantro","diced cilantro","chicken leg"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced cilantro and a raw chicken leg.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . red potato . directions . slice the carrot . roast the carrot . dice the cilantro . slice the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["copy","potato","modern approach","red potato","carrot","slice","rd ed","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","cilantro","recipe","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","red potato","directions","slice the carrot","roast the carrot","dice the cilantro","slice the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  roast the carrot\n  dice the cilantro\n  slice the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin to take stock of whats in the room . whats that over there . it looks like its a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . the patio chair appears to be empty . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a patio table . you wonder idly who left that here . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you can make out a closed bbq in the corner . there is a closed barn door leading south . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["stock","thing","north","wow","patio table","exit","closed bbq","barn door","corner","closed barn door","backyard","sliding patio door","open sliding patio door","south","west","patio chair","room","bbq","aw"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin to take stock of whats in the room","whats that over there","it looks like its a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","the patio chair appears to be empty","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a patio table","you wonder idly who left that here","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you can make out a closed bbq in the corner","there is a closed barn door leading south","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.
