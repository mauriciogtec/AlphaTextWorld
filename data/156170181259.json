The room is well lit.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

The room is well lit.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

The room is well lit.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

The room is well lit.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open screen door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one
