It is! It's a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven close by. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can make out a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw red potato and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just walked into a kitchen.\n\nOh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a closed oven close by. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can make out a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the counter you can make out a banana, a raw red potato and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . red onion . yellow bell pepper . directions . dice the banana . fry the banana . dice the red onion . chop the yellow bell pepper . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","approach","recipe","banana","reading","tasty meal","onion","yellow bell","dice","copy","red onion","yellow bell pepper","prepare meal","meal","bell pepper","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","red onion","yellow bell pepper","directions","dice the banana","fry the banana","dice the red onion","chop the yellow bell pepper","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  red onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  dice the red onion\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cookbook from the table","directions":null,"entities":["table","cookbook"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cookbook from the table"],"text":"You take the cookbook from the table.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw yellow potato and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","pepper","raw yellow potato","fridge","onion","yellow potato","red onion","yellow bell pepper","white onion","hot pepper","black pepper","bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a yellow bell pepper , a red onion , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a raw yellow potato and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"the table is wobbly","directions":null,"entities":["table"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the table is wobbly"],"text":"The table is wobbly.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","banana","counter","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","banana","counter","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
