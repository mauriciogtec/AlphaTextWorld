Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical kind of place . you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa . why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["longer","empty sofa","livingroom","dont worry","picture","dont","nothing","east","sofa","room","place","exit","kind","door","last longer","typical kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical kind of place","you scan the room for a sofa , and you find a sofa","why dont you take a picture of it , itll last longer","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a roasted banana, a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. This always happens!\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?
