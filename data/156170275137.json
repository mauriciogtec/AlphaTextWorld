The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors?

You shudder, but continue examining the room.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the kitchen . you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not . you see a fridge . hmmm . what else , what else . the fridge contains a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg and some water . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than an oven . now why would someone leave that there . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a table . on the table you can see a cookbook . you can see a counter . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the counter is vast . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove . unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it . there is an open screen door leading south . there is an open plain door leading west . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","room","cookbook","complete list","thing","south","isnt textworld","button","someone","hand","counter","hey","plain door","wall","stove","exit","list","kitchen","open screen door","fall","secret button","noise","open plain door","table","wow","hmmm","screen door","raw chicken leg","textworld","thing hasnt","water","chicken leg","west","block","everything","door","cheese","anything","fridge"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well , here we are in the kitchen","you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not","you see a fridge","hmmm","what else , what else","the fridge contains a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg and some water","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than an oven","now why would someone leave that there","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a table","on the table you can see a cookbook","you can see a counter","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the counter is vast","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove","unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it","there is an open screen door leading south","there is an open plain door leading west","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["exit","place","west","east","dont worry","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

You shudder, but continue examining the room.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the kitchen . you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not . you see a fridge . hmmm . what else , what else . the fridge contains a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg and some water . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than an oven . now why would someone leave that there . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a table . on the table you can see a cookbook . you can see a counter . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the counter is vast . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove . unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it . there is an open screen door leading south . there is an open plain door leading west . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","room","cookbook","complete list","thing","south","isnt textworld","button","someone","hand","counter","hey","plain door","wall","stove","exit","list","kitchen","open screen door","fall","secret button","noise","open plain door","table","wow","hmmm","screen door","raw chicken leg","textworld","thing hasnt","water","chicken leg","west","block","everything","door","cheese","anything","fridge"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well , here we are in the kitchen","you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not","you see a fridge","hmmm","what else , what else","the fridge contains a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg and some water","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than an oven","now why would someone leave that there","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a table","on the table you can see a cookbook","you can see a counter","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the counter is vast","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove","unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it","there is an open screen door leading south","there is an open plain door leading west","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["exit","place","west","east","dont worry","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

You shudder, but continue examining the room.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the kitchen . you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not . you see a fridge . hmmm . what else , what else . the fridge contains a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg and some water . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than an oven . now why would someone leave that there . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a table . on the table you can see a cookbook . you can see a counter . wow , isnt textworld just the best . the counter is vast . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove . unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it . there is an open screen door leading south . there is an open plain door leading west . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["entranceway","room","cookbook","complete list","thing","south","isnt textworld","button","someone","hand","counter","hey","plain door","wall","stove","exit","list","kitchen","open screen door","fall","secret button","noise","open plain door","table","wow","hmmm","screen door","raw chicken leg","textworld","thing hasnt","water","chicken leg","west","block","everything","door","cheese","anything","fridge"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["well , here we are in the kitchen","you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not","you see a fridge","hmmm","what else , what else","the fridge contains a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg and some water","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than an oven","now why would someone leave that there","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a table","on the table you can see a cookbook","you can see a counter","wow , isnt textworld just the best","the counter is vast","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove","unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it","there is an open screen door leading south","there is an open plain door leading west","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["exit","place","west","east","dont worry","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["exit","place","west","east","dont worry","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["exit","place","west","east","dont worry","door","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well how about that , you are in the place were calling the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is an exit to the east.

You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south.

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg and some water. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south.
