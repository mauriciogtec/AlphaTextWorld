The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a block of cheese, a cilantro and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a banana, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"thats a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["thats a white onion"],"text":"That's a white onion!\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["yellow potato","counter","score","point","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the yellow potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cookbook from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","cookbook"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cookbook from the counter"],"text":"You take the cookbook from the counter.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the cookbook from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","cookbook"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cookbook from the counter"],"text":"You take the cookbook from the counter.\n\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
