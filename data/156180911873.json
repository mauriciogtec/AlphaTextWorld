Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a knife. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , a diced red onion , a raw red potato and a white

On the counter you can make out a knife. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

On the counter you can make out a knife. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , a diced red onion , a raw red potato and a white

On the counter you can make out a knife. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , a diced red onion , a raw red potato and a white

On the counter you can make out a knife. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , a diced red onion , a raw red potato and a white

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You can make out an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can make out a knife. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , a diced red onion , a raw red potato and a white
