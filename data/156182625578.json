A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a raw pork chop , an orange bell pepper and some water","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell pepper","pork chop","water","fridge","raw pork chop","carrot"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a raw pork chop , an orange bell pepper and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a carrot, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . chicken wing . olive oil . directions . chop the block of cheese . roast the block of cheese . grill the chicken wing . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["olive oil","approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","oil","recipe","modern approach","cheese","chicken wing","prepare meal","block","rd ed","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","chicken wing","olive oil","directions","chop the block of cheese","roast the block of cheese","grill the chicken wing","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  chicken wing\n  olive oil\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  roast the block of cheese\n  grill the chicken wing\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . there is a closed patio door leading north . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west","directions":["north","south","west","east"],"entities":["east","patio door","door","dont worry","closed patio door","entranceway","corridor","exit","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","there is a closed patio door leading north","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.\n\n\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading north.

A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

A standard one.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove.

You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.
