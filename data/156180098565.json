But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove.

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove.

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove.

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You see an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
