The room is well lit.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a yellow bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a black pepper and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The room is well lit.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a yellow bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a black pepper and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a yellow bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a black pepper and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The room is well lit.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a yellow bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a black pepper and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
