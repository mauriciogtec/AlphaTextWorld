Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. Classic TextWorld. Oh, great. Here's an oven. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a cookbook, so there's that. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped raw pork chop","directions":null,"entities":["raw pork chop","chopped raw pork chop","fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a chopped raw pork chop"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a chopped raw pork chop.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","fridge","score","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the pork chop . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the pork chop","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the pork chop.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
