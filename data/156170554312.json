Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a closed fridge.

You see a red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw yellow potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato and a black pepper on the counter. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that raw yellow potato","directions":null,"entities":["raw yellow potato","yellow
