You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried banana, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a yellow bell pepper , a white

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried banana, a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook on the counter.
