When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You make out an oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana and a raw purple potato. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a block of cheese , a carrot , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper , a cilantro and some water","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","water","pepper","white onion","yellow bell pepper","diced red onion","cheese","red hot pepper","hot pepper","onion","red onion","block","cilantro","bell pepper","carrot","orange bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a block of cheese , a carrot , a red hot pepper , a white onion , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper , a cilantro and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced red onion, a block of cheese, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . red onion . directions . fry the block of cheese . dice the red onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","reading","recipe","rd ed","meal","cheese","tasty meal","onion","red onion","copy","prepare meal","block","dice","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","red onion","directions","fry the block of cheese","dice the red onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  fry the block of cheese\n  dice the red onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . red onion . directions . fry the block of cheese . dice the red onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","reading","recipe","rd ed","meal","cheese","tasty meal","onion","red onion","copy","prepare meal","block","dice","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","red onion","directions","fry the block of cheese","dice the red onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  fry the block of cheese\n  dice the red onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","point","onion","red onion","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the fridge.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","red hot pepper","hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the fridge"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the fridge.\n\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
