Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a chopped fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a parsley and some water. You see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","water"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water

Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a chopped fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a parsley and some water. You see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","water"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water

Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a chopped fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a parsley and some water. You see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","water"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a chopped fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a parsley and some water. You see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","water"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water

Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a chopped fried pork chop, a block of cheese, a carrot, a parsley and some water. You see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm.
