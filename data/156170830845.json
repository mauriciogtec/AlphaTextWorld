On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door?
