Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a carrot and a yellow bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . directions . chop the pork chop . fry the pork chop . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["meal","chop","prepare meal","recipe","reading","pork chop","modern approach","approach","tasty meal","rd ed","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","directions","chop the pork chop","fry the pork chop","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n\nDirections:\n  chop the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve just walked into a livingroom . you see a sofa . the sofa is comfy . unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["youve","exit","textworld","thing","door","east","everything","sofa","stuff","entranceway","livingroom"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve just walked into a livingroom","you see a sofa","the sofa is comfy","unfortunately , there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've just walked into a livingroom.\n\nYou see a sofa.
