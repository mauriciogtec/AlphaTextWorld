Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there?

On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.

hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a chopped block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a banana. You see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . slice the red hot pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","block","tasty meal","recipe","copy","cheese","pepper","carrot","reading","meal","slice","approach","hot pepper","prepare meal","modern approach","red hot pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","slice the red hot pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","carrot","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red potato","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red potato"],"text":"You roasted the red potato.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the red potato . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["red potato","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the red potato","not bad"],"text":"You eat the red potato.
