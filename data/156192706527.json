Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. Huh, weird. You make out an oven. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red apple, a red hot pepper and a banana. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can see a stove.
