But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one
