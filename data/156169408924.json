You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? The fridge contains a chopped raw pork chop. You make out an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a raw red potato, a diced red apple, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a raw purple potato on the counter. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove.
