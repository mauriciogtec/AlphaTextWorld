You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You can see a table. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a pantry . you make out a shelf . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . there is an open frosted - glass door leading north","directions":["north"],"entities":["thing hasnt","shelf","anything","glass door","pantry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you find yourself in a pantry","you make out a shelf","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","there is an open frosted - glass door leading north"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou find yourself in a pantry.\n\nYou make out a shelf.
