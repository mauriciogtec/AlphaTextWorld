You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\nThere is an open sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
