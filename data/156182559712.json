There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nYou see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced fried banana, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
