An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. A closed oven is in the room. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. A closed oven is in the room. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. A closed oven is in the room. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.\n\nThere is a closed screen door leading north. There is a closed plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one
