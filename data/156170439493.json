You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a driveway . an ordinary one . you begin to take stock of whats here . there is an open front door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["exit","stock","ordinary one","south","dont worry","one","driveway","front door","open front door","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"driveway","sentences":["you arrive in a driveway","an ordinary one","you begin to take stock of whats here","there is an open front door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Driveway =-\nYou arrive in a driveway.

You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a driveway . an ordinary one . you begin to take stock of whats here . there is an open front door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["exit","stock","ordinary one","south","dont worry","one","driveway","front door","open front door","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"driveway","sentences":["you arrive in a driveway","an ordinary one","you begin to take stock of whats here","there is an open front door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Driveway =-\nYou arrive in a driveway.

You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a driveway . an ordinary one . you begin to take stock of whats here . there is an open front door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["exit","stock","ordinary one","south","dont worry","one","driveway","front door","open front door","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"driveway","sentences":["you arrive in a driveway","an ordinary one","you begin to take stock of whats here","there is an open front door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Driveway =-\nYou arrive in a driveway.

You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a driveway . an ordinary one . you begin to take stock of whats here . there is an open front door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["exit","stock","ordinary one","south","dont worry","one","driveway","front door","open front door","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"driveway","sentences":["you arrive in a driveway","an ordinary one","you begin to take stock of whats here","there is an open front door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Driveway =-\nYou arrive in a driveway.

You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a driveway . an ordinary one . you begin to take stock of whats here . there is an open front door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["exit","stock","ordinary one","south","dont worry","one","driveway","front door","open front door","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"driveway","sentences":["you arrive in a driveway","an ordinary one","you begin to take stock of whats here","there is an open front door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Driveway =-\nYou arrive in a driveway.
