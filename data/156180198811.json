Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. You see a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? On the counter you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. You see a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? On the counter you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . orange bell pepper . red hot pepper . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . fry the orange bell pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","approach","copy","cilantro","tasty meal","meal","prepare meal","red hot pepper","orange bell","modern approach","rd ed","pepper","reading","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","orange bell pepper","red hot pepper","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","fry the orange bell pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  orange bell pepper\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  fry the orange bell pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . orange bell pepper . red hot pepper . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . fry the orange bell pepper . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","approach","copy","cilantro","tasty meal","meal","prepare meal","red hot pepper","orange bell","modern approach","rd ed","pepper","reading","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","orange bell pepper","red hot pepper","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","fry the orange bell pepper","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  orange bell pepper\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  fry the orange bell pepper\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red hot pepper . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","hot pepper","red hot pepper","score","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red hot pepper","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the red hot pepper.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["fried orange bell","diced fried orange bell","orange bell","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried orange bell pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried orange bell pepper.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced fried orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["fried orange bell","diced fried orange bell","orange bell","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced fried orange bell pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced fried orange bell pepper.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
