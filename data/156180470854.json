This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! A closed oven, which looks conventional, is nearby. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
