But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast.

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove.

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove.

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove.

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a parsley. You see an oven. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and
