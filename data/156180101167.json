Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The stove is conventional.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The stove is conventional.
