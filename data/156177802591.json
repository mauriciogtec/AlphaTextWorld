Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the banana . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","banana","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the banana","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the banana.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","inventory","point","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","inventory","point","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
