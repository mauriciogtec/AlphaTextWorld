Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a
