The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a typical one . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["livingroom","hand","anything","fall","dont worry","wall","entranceway","exit","door","thing hasnt","sofa","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a typical one","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.

The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a typical one . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["livingroom","hand","anything","fall","dont worry","wall","entranceway","exit","door","thing hasnt","sofa","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a typical one","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a typical one . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["livingroom","hand","anything","fall","dont worry","wall","entranceway","exit","door","thing hasnt","sofa","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a typical one","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a typical one . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["livingroom","hand","anything","fall","dont worry","wall","entranceway","exit","door","thing hasnt","sofa","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a typical one","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a typical one . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["livingroom","hand","anything","fall","dont worry","wall","entranceway","exit","door","thing hasnt","sofa","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a typical one","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a typical one . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["livingroom","hand","anything","fall","dont worry","wall","entranceway","exit","door","thing hasnt","sofa","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a typical one","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You check the price tag that hangs off the fridge. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You make out an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . parsley . red hot pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . grill the orange bell pepper . dice the parsley . roast the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","prepare meal","approach","red hot pepper","hot pepper","recipe","parsley","modern approach","tasty meal","meal","copy","pepper","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","parsley","red hot pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","grill the orange bell pepper","dice the parsley","roast the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n  parsley\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  grill the orange bell pepper\n  dice the parsley\n  roast the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a typical one . you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["livingroom","hand","anything","fall","dont worry","wall","entranceway","exit","door","thing hasnt","sofa","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a typical one","you rest your hand against a wall , but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.
