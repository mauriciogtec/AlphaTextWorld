Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge here. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the room. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge here. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the room. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
