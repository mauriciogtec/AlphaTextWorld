Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a fried pork chop , a
