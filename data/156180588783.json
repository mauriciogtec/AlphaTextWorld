Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
