A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a grilled carrot. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a closed oven right there by you. You can see a table. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a cookbook on the table. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading north. There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one
