\\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a pantry . an usual one . you see a shelf . but there isnt a thing on it . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["south","shelf","thing","glass door","doesnt","pantry","usual one","one"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you are in a pantry","an usual one","you see a shelf","but there isnt a thing on it","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou are in a pantry.

\\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a pantry . an usual one . you see a shelf . but there isnt a thing on it . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["south","shelf","thing","glass door","doesnt","pantry","usual one","one"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you are in a pantry","an usual one","you see a shelf","but there isnt a thing on it","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou are in a pantry.

\\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a pantry . an usual one . you see a shelf . but there isnt a thing on it . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["south","shelf","thing","glass door","doesnt","pantry","usual one","one"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you are in a pantry","an usual one","you see a shelf","but there isnt a thing on it","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou are in a pantry.

\\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge here. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a pantry . an usual one . you see a shelf . but there isnt a thing on it . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . there is an open frosted - glass door leading south","directions":["south"],"entities":["south","shelf","thing","glass door","doesnt","pantry","usual one","one"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["you are in a pantry","an usual one","you see a shelf","but there isnt a thing on it","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","there is an open frosted - glass door leading south"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou are in a pantry.
