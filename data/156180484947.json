Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and a yellow bell pepper. You can see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a stove! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
