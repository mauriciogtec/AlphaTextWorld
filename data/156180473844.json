This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot and a cilantro. You smell a great smell, and follow it to an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot and a cilantro. You smell a great smell, and follow it to an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a fried carrot and a cilantro. You smell a great smell, and follow it to an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
