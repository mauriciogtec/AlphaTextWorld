Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see an open conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper, so there's that. You see an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see an open conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper, so there's that. You see an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see an open conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper, so there's that. You see an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see an open conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper, so there's that. You see an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see an open conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper, so there's that. You see an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou can see an open conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a red onion, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper, so there's that. You see an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
