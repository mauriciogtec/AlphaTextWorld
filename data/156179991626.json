You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted orange bell pepper , some water , a cilantro , a red hot pepper , a white
