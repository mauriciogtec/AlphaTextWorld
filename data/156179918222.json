A closed oven is right there by you. You make out a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a sliced banana, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . purple potato . yellow potato . directions . slice the banana . fry the banana . roast the purple potato . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","modern approach","recipe","meal","tasty meal","slice","reading","prepare meal","rd ed","copy","approach","potato","yellow potato","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","purple potato","yellow potato","directions","slice the banana","fry the banana","roast the purple potato","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  purple potato\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  roast the purple potato\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a corridor . a typical kind of place . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["west","kind","entranceway","place","north","exit","typical kind","door","corridor","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you arrive in a corridor","a typical kind of place","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou arrive in a corridor.

There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . purple potato . yellow potato . directions . slice the banana . fry the banana . roast the purple potato . chop the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","modern approach","recipe","meal","tasty meal","slice","reading","prepare meal","rd ed","copy","approach","potato","yellow potato","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","purple potato","yellow potato","directions","slice the banana","fry the banana","roast the purple potato","chop the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  purple potato\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  roast the purple potato\n  chop the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a corridor . a typical kind of place . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["west","kind","entranceway","place","north","exit","typical kind","door","corridor","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you arrive in a corridor","a typical kind of place","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou arrive in a corridor.
