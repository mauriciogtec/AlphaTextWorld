Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley, a fried yellow bell pepper, a fried block of cheese, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell pepper","bell
