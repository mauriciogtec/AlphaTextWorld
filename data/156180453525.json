The fridge contains a carrot, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

The fridge contains a carrot, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

The fridge contains a carrot, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

The fridge contains a carrot, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.

Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . pork chop . red apple . directions . roast the carrot . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red apple . roast the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","recipe","copy","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","meal","apple","carrot","red apple","pork chop","rd ed","reading","modern approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","pork chop","red apple","directions","roast the carrot","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red apple","roast the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  roast the carrot\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the cilantro . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the cilantro","not bad"],"text":"You eat the cilantro.
