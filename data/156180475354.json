Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced white onion, a chopped fried carrot, a cilantro, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the stove to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . white onion . directions . chop the carrot . fry the carrot . slice the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["slice","tasty meal","carrot","approach","copy","meal","recipe","cilantro","prepare meal","onion","white onion","modern approach","reading","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","white onion","directions","chop the carrot","fry the carrot","slice the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  chop the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  slice the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . cilantro . white onion . directions . chop the carrot . fry the carrot . slice the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["slice","tasty meal","carrot","approach","copy","meal","recipe","cilantro","prepare meal","onion","white onion","modern approach","reading","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","cilantro","white onion","directions","chop the carrot","fry the carrot","slice the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  cilantro\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  chop the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  slice the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","carrot","score","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","sliced white onion","onion","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced white onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced white onion.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced white onion","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","sliced white onion","onion","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced white onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced white onion.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
