You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove.

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing and a cilantro. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors?

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing and a cilantro. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing and a cilantro. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors?

You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You can make out a stove.
