You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nA closed fridge is here. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a carrot and an orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["carrot","yellow
