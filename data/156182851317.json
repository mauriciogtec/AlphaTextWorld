Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a stove! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","recipe","potato","rd ed","modern approach","prepare meal","tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . yellow potato . directions . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","recipe","potato","rd ed","modern approach","prepare meal","tasty meal","copy","yellow potato","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","yellow potato","directions","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","score","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","score","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
