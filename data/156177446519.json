Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You look at the price tag on the fridge. Forty bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive place? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cilantro","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell pepper","examine oven","examine

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a diced parsley, a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You look at the price tag on the fridge. Forty bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive place? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cilantro","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell pepper","examine oven","examine
