Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A standard one.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a diced roasted white onion , a red onion , a carrot , a block of
