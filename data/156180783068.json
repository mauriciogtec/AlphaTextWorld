Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nGuess what, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . an ordinary one . there is an exit to the east . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["exit","door","dont worry","one","ordinary one","corridor","south","east","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","an ordinary one","there is an exit to the east","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nGuess what, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nGuess what, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nGuess what, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can see a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a corridor . an ordinary one . there is an exit to the east . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["exit","door","dont worry","one","ordinary one","corridor","south","east","west"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a corridor","an ordinary one","there is an exit to the east","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a corridor.
