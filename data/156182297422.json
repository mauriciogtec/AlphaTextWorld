The fridge contains a sliced block of cheese, a diced cilantro, a raw pork chop, an orange bell pepper and a white onion. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. You see a cookbook on the table, so there's that. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a chopped fried purple potato and a raw red potato on the counter. Look over there! a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Here's a table. You see a cookbook on the table, so there's that. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a chopped fried purple potato and a raw red potato on the counter. Look over there! a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . cilantro . purple potato . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the cilantro . chop the purple potato . fry the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","recipe","slice","approach","tasty meal","block","rd ed","copy","meal","purple potato","cilantro","cheese","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","cilantro","purple potato","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the cilantro","chop the purple potato","fry the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  cilantro\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the cilantro\n  chop the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . cilantro . purple potato . directions . slice the block of cheese . dice the cilantro . chop the purple potato . fry the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","modern approach","recipe","slice","approach","tasty meal","block","rd ed","copy","meal","purple potato","cilantro","cheese","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","cilantro","purple potato","directions","slice the block of cheese","dice the cilantro","chop the purple potato","fry the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  cilantro\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  dice the cilantro\n  chop the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","cilantro","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","counter","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","counter","score","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
