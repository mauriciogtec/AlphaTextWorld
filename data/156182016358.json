Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains some water. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven, so there's that. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table! On the table you make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . water . directions . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","recipe","meal","prepare meal","tasty meal","water","modern approach","copy","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","water","directions","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . water . directions . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","rd ed","recipe","meal","prepare meal","tasty meal","water","modern approach","copy","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","water","directions","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","fridge","point","water"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
