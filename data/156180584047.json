You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a diced white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper and some

You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You make out a closed oven here. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.
