Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced roasted orange bell pepper , a raw chicken leg and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["black pepper","pepper","roasted orange bell pepper","fridge","raw chicken leg","chicken leg","orange bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a sliced roasted orange bell pepper , a raw chicken leg and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a sliced roasted orange bell pepper, a raw chicken leg and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . flour . orange bell pepper . directions . slice the block of cheese . slice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","orange bell","reading","meal","cheese","rd ed","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal","block","approach","copy","recipe","flour"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","flour","orange bell pepper","directions","slice the block of cheese","slice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the block of cheese\n  slice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a backyard . you can see a patio table . the patio table appears to be empty . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a patio chair . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . you can see a bbq . there is a closed barn door leading north . there is an open sliding patio door leading west . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["west","closed barn door","patio table","barn door","door","backyard","exit","aw","patio chair","open sliding patio door","sliding patio door","thing","bbq"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you find yourself in a backyard","you can see a patio table","the patio table appears to be empty","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a patio chair","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","you can see a bbq","there is a closed barn door leading north","there is an open sliding patio door leading west","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou find yourself in a backyard.\n\nYou can see a patio table.
