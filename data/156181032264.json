You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. You see a red apple and a cookbook on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nA closed fridge is right there by you. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. You see a red apple and a cookbook on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","raw chicken wing","orange bell pepper","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing.\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the corridor . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . there is a closed screen door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["screen door","exit","closed screen door","text adventure","youre","door","room","south","everything","corridor","entranceway","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youre now in the corridor","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","there is a closed screen door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou're now in the corridor.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. You see a red apple and a cookbook on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","raw chicken wing","orange bell pepper","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing.\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the corridor . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . there is a closed screen door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["screen door","exit","closed screen door","text adventure","youre","door","room","south","everything","corridor","entranceway","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youre now in the corridor","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","there is a closed screen door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou're now in the corridor.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. You see a red apple and a cookbook on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","raw chicken wing","orange bell pepper","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper and a raw chicken wing.\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in the corridor . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . there is a closed screen door leading north . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["screen door","exit","closed screen door","text adventure","youre","door","room","south","everything","corridor","entranceway","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youre now in the corridor","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","there is a closed screen door leading north","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou're now in the corridor.

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
