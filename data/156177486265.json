Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a closed oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. On the counter you can make out a diced banana, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a raw red potato. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine banana","examine cilantro","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine oven","examine purple

Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a closed oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. On the counter you can make out a diced banana, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a raw red potato. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["potato","yellow

It seems to be pretty ordinary here. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a closed oven in the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. On the counter you can make out a diced banana, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a raw red potato. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south.
