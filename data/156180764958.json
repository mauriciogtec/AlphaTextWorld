Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a diced roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, some water and a black pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh, great. Here's a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a chopped roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a red onion, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . red apple . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the red apple . roast the red apple . dice the yellow bell pepper . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","yellow bell","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","cilantro","copy","chop","red apple","modern approach","rd ed","approach","reading","recipe","meal","apple","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","red apple","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the red apple","roast the red apple","dice the yellow bell pepper","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  red apple\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  dice the yellow bell pepper\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . red apple . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the red apple . roast the red apple . dice the yellow bell pepper . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","yellow bell","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","cilantro","copy","chop","red apple","modern approach","rd ed","approach","reading","recipe","meal","apple","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","red apple","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the red apple","roast the red apple","dice the yellow bell pepper","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  red apple\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the red apple\n  roast the red apple\n  dice the yellow bell pepper\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["potato","yellow potato","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow potato from the fridge"],"text":"You take the yellow potato from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","score","point","red apple","apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red apple from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red apple from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the yellow potato","directions":null,"entities":["potato","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the yellow potato"],"text":"You roasted the yellow potato.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you roasted the yellow potato","directions":null,"entities":["potato","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the yellow potato"],"text":"You roasted the yellow potato.\n\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
