There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOf every kitchen you could have walked into, you had to saunter into a typical one.\n\nYou can see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty stove?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . pork chop . red apple . directions . slice the parsley . fry the pork chop . slice the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","reading","copy","pork chop","rd ed","modern approach","recipe","red apple","meal","apple","approach","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","pork chop","red apple","directions","slice the parsley","fry the pork chop","slice the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  slice the parsley\n  fry the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . pork chop . red apple . directions . slice the parsley . fry the pork chop . slice the red apple . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","reading","copy","pork chop","rd ed","modern approach","recipe","red apple","meal","apple","approach","tasty meal","slice","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","pork chop","red apple","directions","slice the parsley","fry the pork chop","slice the red apple","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  pork chop\n  red apple\n\nDirections:\n  slice the parsley\n  fry the pork chop\n  slice the red apple\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced parsley","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","sliced parsley","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced parsley"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced parsley.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced parsley","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","sliced parsley","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced parsley"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced parsley.\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
