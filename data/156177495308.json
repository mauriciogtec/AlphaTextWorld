Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty typical. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a red onion, a white onion, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you make out a diced raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine orange bell pepper","examine oven","examine
