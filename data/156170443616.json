The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cilantro","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine pork
