Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. On the counter you can make out a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water","directions":null,"entities":["water","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","water","fridge","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
