If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Backyard =-\nThis backyard you have just entered is definitely usual. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio chair! oh well. You scan the room for a BBQ, and you find a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open barn door leading east. There is an open screen door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a shed . an ordinary one . look over there . a toolbox . the toolbox is empty . this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever . you make out a workbench . the workbench is wooden . but the thing is empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . there is an open barn door leading west","directions":["west"],"entities":["one","toolbox","look","thing","ordinary one","workbench","oh","west","barn door","open barn door","couldnt"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"shed","sentences":["you are in a shed","an ordinary one","look over there","a toolbox","the toolbox is empty","this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever","you make out a workbench","the workbench is wooden","but the thing is empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","there is an open barn door leading west"],"text":"\n-= Shed =-\nYou are in a shed.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Backyard =-\nThis backyard you have just entered is definitely usual. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio chair! oh well. You scan the room for a BBQ, and you find a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open barn door leading east. There is an open screen door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a shed . an ordinary one . look over there . a toolbox . the toolbox is empty . this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever . you make out a workbench . the workbench is wooden . but the thing is empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . there is an open barn door leading west","directions":["west"],"entities":["one","toolbox","look","thing","ordinary one","workbench","oh","west","barn door","open barn door","couldnt"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"shed","sentences":["you are in a shed","an ordinary one","look over there","a toolbox","the toolbox is empty","this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever","you make out a workbench","the workbench is wooden","but the thing is empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","there is an open barn door leading west"],"text":"\n-= Shed =-\nYou are in a shed.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Backyard =-\nThis backyard you have just entered is definitely usual. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio chair! oh well. You scan the room for a BBQ, and you find a BBQ.\n\nThere is an open barn door leading east. There is an open screen door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a shed . an ordinary one . look over there . a toolbox . the toolbox is empty . this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever . you make out a workbench . the workbench is wooden . but the thing is empty . oh . why couldnt there just be stuff on it . there is an open barn door leading west","directions":["west"],"entities":["one","toolbox","look","thing","ordinary one","workbench","oh","west","barn door","open barn door","couldnt"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"shed","sentences":["you are in a shed","an ordinary one","look over there","a toolbox","the toolbox is empty","this is the worst thing that could possibly happen , ever","you make out a workbench","the workbench is wooden","but the thing is empty","oh","why couldnt there just be stuff on it","there is an open barn door leading west"],"text":"\n-= Shed =-\nYou are in a shed.
