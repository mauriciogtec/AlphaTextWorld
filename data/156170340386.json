Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you couldnt pay me to eat that white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have stumbled into the most normal of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive.

You see a diced red apple, a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion and an orange bell pepper on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.
