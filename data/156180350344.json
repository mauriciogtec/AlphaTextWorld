You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm.

The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there?

The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm.

You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there?

You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there?

You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there?

You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there?

You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. 70 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty
