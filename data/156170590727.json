You see a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a banana on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

You see a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a banana on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

You see a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a banana on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red onion and a block of cheese. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a banana on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","point","orange bell","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the orange bell pepper from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","water","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","water","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
