Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge nearby. You see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a red hot pepper and a white

You see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a red hot pepper and a white

You see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a red hot pepper and a white

You see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a counter. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced red onion , a carrot , a block of cheese , a red hot pepper and a white
