The wall opens up to reveal a stove! The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Huh, weird. You can make out a table.
