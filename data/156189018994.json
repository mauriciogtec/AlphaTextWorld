You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You check the price tag that the fridge's owner still hasn't taken off. 30 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a counter. You see a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
