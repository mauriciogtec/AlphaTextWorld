You can make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits in a fire, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You can see a counter.

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
