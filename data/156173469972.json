Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. The room is well lit.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a parsley. You see a closed oven. You can see a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a chopped banana, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","banana","score","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the banana . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","banana","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the banana","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the banana.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","point","score","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","point","score","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
