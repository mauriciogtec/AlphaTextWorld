Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion and some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion and some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . the room is well lit . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","north","south","west","corridor","exit","room","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","the room is well lit","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion and some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . the room is well lit . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","north","south","west","corridor","exit","room","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","the room is well lit","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion and some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . the room is well lit . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","north","south","west","corridor","exit","room","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","the room is well lit","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion and some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove.

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion and some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove.

You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a sliced carrot, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion and some water. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove.

You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . carrot . red onion . directions . slice the banana . slice the carrot . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","approach","rd ed","banana","red onion","onion","slice","modern approach","tasty meal","recipe","copy","carrot","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","carrot","red onion","directions","slice the banana","slice the carrot","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  carrot\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  slice the carrot\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . the room is well lit . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","north","south","west","corridor","exit","room","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","the room is well lit","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.

You wonder idly who left that here. You can make out a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced banana. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . carrot . red onion . directions . slice the banana . slice the carrot . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","approach","rd ed","banana","red onion","onion","slice","modern approach","tasty meal","recipe","copy","carrot","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","carrot","red onion","directions","slice the banana","slice the carrot","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  carrot\n  red onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  slice the carrot\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . the room is well lit . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["door","north","south","west","corridor","exit","room","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","the room is well lit","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.
