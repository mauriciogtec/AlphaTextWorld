Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing some water , a fried block of cheese and a white
