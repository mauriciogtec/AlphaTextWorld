Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty standard.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a stove. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . purple potato . directions . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","recipe","purple potato","modern approach","copy","approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","rd ed","pork chop","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","purple potato","directions","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a standard kind of place . that is to say , youre in a corridor . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["south","corridor","kind","door","entranceway","youre","dont worry","place","standard kind","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a standard kind of place","that is to say , youre in a corridor","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a standard kind of place.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty standard.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a stove. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . purple potato . directions . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","recipe","purple potato","modern approach","copy","approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","rd ed","pork chop","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","purple potato","directions","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a standard kind of place . that is to say , youre in a corridor . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["south","corridor","kind","door","entranceway","youre","dont worry","place","standard kind","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a standard kind of place","that is to say , youre in a corridor","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a standard kind of place.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty standard.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a stove.

Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . purple potato . directions . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","recipe","purple potato","modern approach","copy","approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","rd ed","pork chop","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","purple potato","directions","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a standard kind of place . that is to say , youre in a corridor . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["south","corridor","kind","door","entranceway","youre","dont worry","place","standard kind","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a standard kind of place","that is to say , youre in a corridor","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a standard kind of place.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty standard.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a stove.

Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . purple potato . directions . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","recipe","purple potato","modern approach","copy","approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","rd ed","pork chop","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","purple potato","directions","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a standard kind of place . that is to say , youre in a corridor . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["south","corridor","kind","door","entranceway","youre","dont worry","place","standard kind","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a standard kind of place","that is to say , youre in a corridor","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a standard kind of place.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty standard.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a stove.

Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . purple potato . directions . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","recipe","purple potato","modern approach","copy","approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","rd ed","pork chop","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","purple potato","directions","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a standard kind of place . that is to say , youre in a corridor . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["south","corridor","kind","door","entranceway","youre","dont worry","place","standard kind","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a standard kind of place","that is to say , youre in a corridor","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a standard kind of place.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty standard.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a stove. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . purple potato . directions . slice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . dice the purple potato . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","recipe","purple potato","modern approach","copy","approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","rd ed","pork chop","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","purple potato","directions","slice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","dice the purple potato","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  dice the purple potato\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a standard kind of place . that is to say , youre in a corridor . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you dont like doors . why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the south . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["south","corridor","kind","door","entranceway","youre","dont worry","place","standard kind","exit"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you find yourself in a standard kind of place","that is to say , youre in a corridor","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you dont like doors","why not try going north , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the south","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou find yourself in a standard kind of place.
