Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou see a fridge. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw chicken leg, a red onion, a raw chicken wing, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in a corridor . you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["corridor","east","technique","north","dont worry","exit","information","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in a corridor","you try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call looking","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in a corridor.

The fridge contains a raw chicken leg, a red onion, a raw chicken wing, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

The fridge contains a raw chicken leg, a red onion, a raw chicken wing, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can see a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife.
