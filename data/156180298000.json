You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. You wonder idly who left that here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
