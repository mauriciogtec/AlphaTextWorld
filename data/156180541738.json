Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve come into a typical room . your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical . and then it hits you . of course . youre in the corridor . there is an exit to the east . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["west","youve","kind","course","youre","exit","room","corridor","door","east","typical room","mind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve come into a typical room","your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical","and then it hits you","of course","youre in the corridor","there is an exit to the east","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've come into a typical room.

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou can make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a parsley. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door?

You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana and a red apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button.
