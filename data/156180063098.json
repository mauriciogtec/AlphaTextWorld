Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge in the corner. You can see an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried banana, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped fried carrot , a red onion , a block of cheese , a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["chopped fried carrot","fridge","yellow bell pepper","cheese","fried carrot","onion","red onion","block","cilantro","bell pepper","carrot"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a chopped fried carrot , a red onion , a block of cheese , a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a chopped fried carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper and a cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . carrot . directions . slice the banana . fry the banana . chop the carrot . fry the carrot . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","slice","reading","recipe","rd ed","meal","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","carrot","banana","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","carrot","directions","slice the banana","fry the banana","chop the carrot","fry the carrot","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  carrot\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . carrot . directions . slice the banana . fry the banana . chop the carrot . fry the carrot . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","slice","reading","recipe","rd ed","meal","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","carrot","banana","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","carrot","directions","slice the banana","fry the banana","chop the carrot","fry the carrot","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  carrot\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  fry the banana\n  chop the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["carrot","point","fridge","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["carrot","point","fridge","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
