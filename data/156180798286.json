Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it typical? You better believe it is.\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You see a closed oven close by. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a banana, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nOkay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it typical? You better believe it is.\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. You see a closed oven close by. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? You see a banana, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
