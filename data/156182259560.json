Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a fried yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a red hot pepper. You see an oven. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you see a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . olive oil . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["rd ed","reading","yellow bell pepper","copy","recipe","cilantro","meal","oil","yellow bell","approach","bell pepper","modern approach","tasty meal","olive oil","prepare meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","olive oil","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  olive oil\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a livingroom . you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a sofa . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . there is an exit to the north . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one . you need an exit without a door . you should try going west","directions":["north","south","west"],"entities":["wow","entranceway","door","room","complete list","exit","nothing","livingroom","hey","sofa","empty sofa","stuff","list","everything","textworld","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve entered a livingroom","you decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room , because hey , why not","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a sofa","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","there is an exit to the north","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","you need an exit without a door","you should try going west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've entered a livingroom.

You see a counter. On the counter you see a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You see a counter. On the counter you see a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors?

You see a counter. On the counter you see a red apple. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
