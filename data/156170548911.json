Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the

You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a parsley and some water. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a livingroom . a typical one . you start to take note of whats in the room . you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button . the wall opens up to reveal a sofa . the sofa is comfy . looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though . hopefully this doesnt make you too upset . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["button","room","everything","doesnt","exit","west","livingroom","secret button","note","wall","door","sofa"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you arrive in a livingroom","a typical one","you start to take note of whats in the room","you lean against the wall , inadvertently pressing a secret button","the wall opens up to reveal a sofa","the sofa is comfy","looks like someones already been here and taken everything off it , though","hopefully this doesnt make you too upset","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou arrive in a livingroom.

You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a fried red hot pepper, a banana, a raw red potato and a black pepper on the counter. You make out a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. This always happens!\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors?
