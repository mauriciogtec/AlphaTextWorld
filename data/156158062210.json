Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","point","score","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . directions . slice the banana . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["slice","rd ed","approach","banana","copy","meal","prepare meal","reading","modern approach","recipe","tasty meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","directions","slice the banana","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the parsley from the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["parsley","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the parsley from the fridge"],"text":"You take the parsley from the fridge.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the knife from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","knife"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the knife from the counter"],"text":"You take the knife from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you slice the banana . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","banana"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you slice the banana","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You slice the banana.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","point","score","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["meal","point","score","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
