Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove.

The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a red hot pepper, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
