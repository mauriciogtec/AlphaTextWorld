This is some kind of kitchen, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... oven? You make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly furious with your TextWorld experience.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted white onion , a raw chicken wing , a red onion , a raw pork chop and some water","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw chicken wing","onion","chicken wing","water","raw pork chop","fridge","red onion","diced roasted white onion","roasted white onion","white onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted white onion , a raw chicken wing , a red onion , a raw pork chop and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced roasted white onion, a raw chicken wing, a red onion, a raw pork chop and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"look around you . take it all in . its not every day someone gets to be in a backyard . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you see a patio table . the patio table appears to be empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a patio chair . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . hm . oh well you can make out a closed bbq , which looks recent , right there by you . there is an open wooden door leading north . there is an open patio door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["nothing","entranceway","anything","west","room","day someone","patio door","empty patio chair","patio table","open wooden door","hm","wooden door","stuff","patio chair","bbq","closed bbq","look","everything","backyard","open patio door","noise","text adventure"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["look around you","take it all in","its not every day someone gets to be in a backyard","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you see a patio table","the patio table appears to be empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a patio chair","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","hm","oh well you can make out a closed bbq , which looks recent , right there by you","there is an open wooden door leading north","there is an open patio door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nLook around you.

This is some kind of kitchen, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.\n\nWere you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... oven? You make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly furious with your TextWorld experience.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted white onion , a raw chicken wing , a red onion , a raw pork chop and some water","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw chicken wing","onion","chicken wing","water","raw pork chop","fridge","red onion","diced roasted white onion","roasted white onion","white onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a diced roasted white onion , a raw chicken wing , a red onion , a raw pork chop and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a diced roasted white onion, a raw chicken wing, a red onion, a raw pork chop and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"look around you . take it all in . its not every day someone gets to be in a backyard . you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure . you see a patio table . the patio table appears to be empty . it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table . you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a patio chair . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . hm . oh well you can make out a closed bbq , which looks recent , right there by you . there is an open wooden door leading north . there is an open patio door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","west","east"],"entities":["nothing","entranceway","anything","west","room","day someone","patio door","empty patio chair","patio table","open wooden door","hm","wooden door","stuff","patio chair","bbq","closed bbq","look","everything","backyard","open patio door","noise","text adventure"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["look around you","take it all in","its not every day someone gets to be in a backyard","you decide to start listing off everything you see in the room , as if you were in a text adventure","you see a patio table","the patio table appears to be empty","it would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table","you hear a noise behind you and spin around , but you cant see anything other than a patio chair","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","hm","oh well you can make out a closed bbq , which looks recent , right there by you","there is an open wooden door leading north","there is an open patio door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nLook around you.
