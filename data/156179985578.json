Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The shelf is wooden. On the shelf you make out a black pepper and some olive oil.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a kitchen . you scan the room , seeing a fridge . the fridge contains a raw pork chop , a yellow bell pepper and a carrot . hey , want to see an oven . look over there , an oven . you see a table . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . you can see a counter . the counter is vast . on the counter you make out a red hot pepper , a cookbook and a knife . you see a stove . the stove is conventional . however , the stove , like an empty stove , has nothing on it . hm . oh well . there is an open plain door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["knife","entranceway","west","cookbook","carrot","look","pepper","yellow bell pepper","nothing","kitchen","oven","empty stove","bell pepper","red hot pepper","plain door","table","south","room","hey","stove","pork chop","fridge","hm","open plain door","exit","thing","counter","hot pepper","raw pork chop"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"kitchen","sentences":["youve entered a kitchen","you scan the room , seeing a fridge","the fridge contains a raw pork chop , a yellow bell pepper and a carrot","hey , want to see an oven","look over there , an oven","you see a table","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","you can see a counter","the counter is vast","on the counter you make out a red hot pepper , a cookbook and a knife","you see a stove","the stove is conventional","however , the stove , like an empty stove , has nothing on it","hm","oh well","there is an open plain door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou scan the room, seeing a fridge.
