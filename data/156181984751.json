Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a red apple. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a roasted pork chop , a block of cheese , an orange bell pepper , a carrot , a
