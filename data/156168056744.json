You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.

The fridge contains a red onion, a white onion, a red apple, an orange bell pepper and a parsley. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the corner. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. On the counter you see a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional.
