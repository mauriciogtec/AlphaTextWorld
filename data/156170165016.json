Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true}]
