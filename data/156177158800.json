A normal one.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced raw yellow potato, a diced raw purple potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cookbook from the
