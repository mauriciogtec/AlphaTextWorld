This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nAh, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is shaky . on the counter are a red hot pepper and a knife","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","hot
