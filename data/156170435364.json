Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge! The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a block of cheese and a white onion. You can see an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a diced fried red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. The room is well lit.\n\nYou make out a fridge! The fridge contains a diced roasted orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a block of cheese and a white onion. You can see an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a diced fried red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one
