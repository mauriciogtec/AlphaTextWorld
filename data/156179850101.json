Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou see a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? A closed oven is right there by you. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table, so there's that. You see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. You see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a banana on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced fried pork chop , some water and an orange bell
