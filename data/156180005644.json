You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. You can see a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. You can see a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. You can see a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. You can see a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. You can see a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. You can see a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell, here we are in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou make out an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. You can see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. You can see a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. You see a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
