You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east.

You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a livingroom . if you havent noticed it already , there seems to be something there by the wall , its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . this always happens , here in textworld . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["wall","livingroom","sofa","exit","something","door","thing","textworld","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve entered a livingroom","if you havent noticed it already , there seems to be something there by the wall , its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","this always happens , here in textworld","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've entered a livingroom.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa.

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nI just think it's awesome that you're in a kitchen now.\n\nYou smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a fridge. You can make out an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a livingroom . if you havent noticed it already , there seems to be something there by the wall , its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . this always happens , here in textworld . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["wall","livingroom","sofa","exit","something","door","thing","textworld","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve entered a livingroom","if you havent noticed it already , there seems to be something there by the wall , its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","this always happens , here in textworld","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've entered a livingroom.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa.

You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a livingroom . if you havent noticed it already , there seems to be something there by the wall , its a sofa . the sofa is comfy . but the thing is empty . this always happens , here in textworld . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north","directions":["north","east"],"entities":["wall","livingroom","sofa","exit","something","door","thing","textworld","north"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["youve entered a livingroom","if you havent noticed it already , there seems to be something there by the wall , its a sofa","the sofa is comfy","but the thing is empty","this always happens , here in textworld","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou've entered a livingroom.\n\nIf you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa.
