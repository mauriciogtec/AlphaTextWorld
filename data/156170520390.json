An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see a closed conventional looking fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see a closed conventional looking fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see a closed conventional looking fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see a closed conventional looking fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one

An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou see a closed conventional looking fridge in the corner. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading north. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one
