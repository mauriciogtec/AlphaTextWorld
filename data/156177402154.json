Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a carrot, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a block of cheese, a parsley, a cilantro and some water. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a red onion and a cookbook on the counter. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["apple","counter","red apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red apple from the counter"],"text":"You take the red apple from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","point","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","point","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":2,"mainbranch":true}]
