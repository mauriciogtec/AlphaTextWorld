Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a carrot. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Classic TextWorld. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine carrot","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine oven","examine red hot

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a carrot. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Classic TextWorld. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine carrot","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine oven","examine red hot

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a carrot. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Classic TextWorld. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine carrot","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine oven","examine red hot

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a carrot. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Classic TextWorld. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine carrot","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine oven","examine red hot

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a carrot. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Classic TextWorld. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine carrot","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine oven","examine red hot

Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best?

An usual one.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a carrot. I mean, just wow!

Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door?

Just like in the movies! You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door?
