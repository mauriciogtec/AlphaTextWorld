On the table you can make out a cookbook. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens! You can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east.
