On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh!

You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh!

That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh!

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains some water and a carrot. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple and a black pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
