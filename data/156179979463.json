Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nWell how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nA closed fridge is right there by you. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the oven. Three hundred bucks?! That's ridiculous! You ever meet my good friend, they work for a company? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 60 bucks! You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is a closed plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a red onion , a parsley and some water","directions":null,"entities":["water","fridge","onion","red onion","carrot","parsley"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a carrot , a red onion , a parsley and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a carrot, a red onion, a parsley and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"youre now in a pantry . oh wow . is that what i think it is . it is . its a shelf . you see a black pepper , an orange bell pepper and a salt on the shelf . there is an open plain door leading west","directions":["west"],"entities":["shelf","west","wow","black pepper","pantry","youre","salt","plain door","open plain door","orange bell pepper","pepper"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"pantry","sentences":["youre now in a pantry","oh wow","is that what i think it is","it is","its a shelf","you see a black pepper , an orange bell pepper and a salt on the shelf","there is an open plain door leading west"],"text":"\n-= Pantry =-\nYou're now in a pantry.\n\nOh wow!

There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional.
