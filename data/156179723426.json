Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
