The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a raw chicken leg, a raw chicken wing and some water. You make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table! oh well. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open patio door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is unstable . on the counter are a sliced roasted purple potato , a raw yellow potato , a cookbook and a
