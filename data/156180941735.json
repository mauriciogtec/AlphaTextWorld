A typical one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven in the room. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a stove. You can't really describe the stove besides that it's conventional. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop and a block

A typical one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a closed oven in the room. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced fried yellow potato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a stove. You can't really describe the stove besides that it's conventional. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a roasted yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper , a raw pork chop and a block
