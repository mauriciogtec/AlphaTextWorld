It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","onion","white
