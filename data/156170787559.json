Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can see an oven. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["inventory","meal","point","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true}]
