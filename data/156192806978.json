Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty standard here. Let's see what's in here.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains some water, a raw pork chop, a block of cheese and a cilantro. You can make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a red apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one
