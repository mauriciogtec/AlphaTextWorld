The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional.

You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional.

You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nThis might come as a shock to you, but you've just fallen into a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a block of cheese, a white onion and a black pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you see a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a banana and a raw purple potato. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red hot pepper . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . chop the yellow bell pepper . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["pepper","red hot pepper","chop","modern approach","hot pepper","tasty meal","yellow bell","prepare meal","copy","bell pepper","rd ed","yellow bell pepper","approach","recipe","reading","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red hot pepper","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","chop the yellow bell pepper","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red hot pepper\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red hot pepper . yellow bell pepper . directions . chop the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . chop the yellow bell pepper . roast the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["pepper","red hot pepper","chop","modern approach","hot pepper","tasty meal","yellow bell","prepare meal","copy","bell pepper","rd ed","yellow bell pepper","approach","recipe","reading","meal"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red hot pepper","yellow bell pepper","directions","chop the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","chop the yellow bell pepper","roast the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red hot pepper\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  roast the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the orange bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the orange bell pepper from the counter"],"text":"You take the orange bell pepper from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","hot pepper","score","point","counter","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the orange bell pepper"],"text":"You roasted the orange bell pepper.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped fried red hot pepper","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","hot pepper","fried red hot pepper","chopped fried red hot pepper","recipe","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped fried red hot pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped fried red hot pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you eat the orange bell pepper . not bad","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you eat the orange bell pepper","not bad"],"text":"You eat the orange bell pepper.
