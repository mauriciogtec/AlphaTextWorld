You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , some water , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a carrot and a yellow

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , some water , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a carrot and a yellow

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , some water , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a carrot and a yellow

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , some water , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a carrot and a yellow

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , some water , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a carrot and a yellow

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , some water , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a carrot and a yellow

You begin to take stock of what's in the room.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a white onion , some water , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a carrot and a yellow
