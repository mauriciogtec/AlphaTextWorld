An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some

\n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. You can see an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a red hot pepper on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper , a yellow bell pepper and some
