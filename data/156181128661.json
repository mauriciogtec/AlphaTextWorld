It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nLook out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains a chopped fried yellow bell pepper, a diced parsley, a block of cheese, a raw yellow potato, an orange bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot and a cilantro. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a diced red apple, a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . red apple . yellow bell pepper . directions . dice the parsley . dice the red apple . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","modern approach","dice","yellow bell pepper","red apple","recipe","prepare meal","rd ed","parsley","approach","yellow bell","meal","tasty meal","bell pepper","apple","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","red apple","yellow bell pepper","directions","dice the parsley","dice the red apple","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  red apple\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the parsley\n  dice the red apple\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . parsley . red apple . yellow bell pepper . directions . dice the parsley . dice the red apple . chop the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","modern approach","dice","yellow bell pepper","red apple","recipe","prepare meal","rd ed","parsley","approach","yellow bell","meal","tasty meal","bell pepper","apple","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","parsley","red apple","yellow bell pepper","directions","dice the parsley","dice the red apple","chop the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  parsley\n  red apple\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  dice the parsley\n  dice the red apple\n  chop the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red apple from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red apple","counter","score","point","apple"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red apple from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red apple from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["potato","counter","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["potato","counter","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
