You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried pork chop, some water and a cilantro. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... fridge? You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red potato . water . directions . slice the pork chop . fry the pork chop . chop the red potato . fry the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","pork chop","potato","red potato","rd ed","water","copy","modern approach","tasty meal","slice","chop","recipe","prepare meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red potato","water","directions","slice the pork chop","fry the pork chop","chop the red potato","fry the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red potato\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  slice the pork chop\n  fry the pork chop\n  chop the red potato\n  fry the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","potato","red potato","counter","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the fridge looks manageable . you can see inside it . in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","water","fried pork chop","cilantro","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the fridge looks manageable","you can see inside it","in the fridge are a fried pork chop , some water and a cilantro"],"text":"The fridge looks manageable.
