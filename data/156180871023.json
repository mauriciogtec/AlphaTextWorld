There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains some water, a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and a cilantro. Oh, great. Here's an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a table. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a counter! The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
