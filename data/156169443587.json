You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see a fridge. You can see an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you see a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.

On the counter you can see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a banana, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional.
