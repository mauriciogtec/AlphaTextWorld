Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing. Huh, weird. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an open patio door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a standard kind of place . the room seems oddly familiar , as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building . you can make out a sofa . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a sofa , go to textworld . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["building","youre","dont worry","livingroom","sofa","thing hasnt","place","door","entranceway","west","anything","standard kind","exit","room","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a standard kind of place","the room seems oddly familiar , as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building","you can make out a sofa","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a sofa , go to textworld","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in a kitchen.\n\nYou can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken wing. Huh, weird. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an open patio door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you find yourself in a livingroom . a standard kind of place . the room seems oddly familiar , as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building . you can make out a sofa . i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a sofa , go to textworld . the sofa is comfy . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["west","east"],"entities":["building","youre","dont worry","livingroom","sofa","thing hasnt","place","door","entranceway","west","anything","standard kind","exit","room","kind"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["you find yourself in a livingroom","a standard kind of place","the room seems oddly familiar , as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building","you can make out a sofa","i guess its true what they say , if youre looking for a sofa , go to textworld","the sofa is comfy","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nYou find yourself in a livingroom.
