Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just shown up in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.\n\nYou see a fridge. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a black pepper and a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","fridge","red onion","onion","orange bell","white onion","chopped white onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a chopped white onion , a diced roasted pork chop , a red onion and an orange bell pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a chopped white onion, a diced roasted pork chop, a red onion and an orange bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red hot pepper . white onion . directions . dice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . chop the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","hot pepper","copy","dice","prepare meal","rd ed","pork chop","red hot pepper","approach","reading","meal","pepper","onion","slice","modern approach","white onion","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red hot pepper","white onion","directions","dice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","chop the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red hot pepper\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  chop the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . pork chop . red hot pepper . white onion . directions . dice the pork chop . roast the pork chop . slice the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . chop the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","hot pepper","copy","dice","prepare meal","rd ed","pork chop","red hot pepper","approach","reading","meal","pepper","onion","slice","modern approach","white onion","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","pork chop","red hot pepper","white onion","directions","dice the pork chop","roast the pork chop","slice the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","chop the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  pork chop\n  red hot pepper\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the pork chop\n  roast the pork chop\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  chop the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the pork chop from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","point","fridge","score"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the pork chop from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the pork chop from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","point","counter","score","red hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["hot pepper","point","counter","score","red hot pepper","pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
