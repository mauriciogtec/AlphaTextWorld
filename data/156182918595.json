Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro, a carrot, a raw pork chop, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese and a black pepper. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a raw yellow potato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove.

But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . orange bell pepper . purple potato . directions . dice the cilantro . slice the orange bell pepper . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","reading","recipe","cilantro","purple potato","tasty meal","rd ed","approach","orange bell","modern approach","meal","copy","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","orange bell pepper","purple potato","directions","dice the cilantro","slice the orange bell pepper","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  orange bell pepper\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the cilantro\n  slice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . orange bell pepper . purple potato . directions . dice the cilantro . slice the orange bell pepper . roast the purple potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["prepare meal","reading","recipe","cilantro","purple potato","tasty meal","rd ed","approach","orange bell","modern approach","meal","copy","slice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","orange bell pepper","purple potato","directions","dice the cilantro","slice the orange bell pepper","roast the purple potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  orange bell pepper\n  purple potato\n\nDirections:\n  dice the cilantro\n  slice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the purple potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["cilantro","point","score","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the purple potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","point","score","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the purple potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the purple potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["potato","counter","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the red potato from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["potato","counter","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red potato from the counter"],"text":"You take the red potato from the counter.\n\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
