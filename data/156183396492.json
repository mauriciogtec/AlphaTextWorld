As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open patio door"],"text":"You open patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a backyard . an ordinary one . you can see a patio table . the patio table appears to be empty . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you make out a patio chair . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . you scan the room , seeing a bbq . there is a closed wooden door leading south . there is an open patio door leading west . there is an exit to the east","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["ordinary one","everything","patio table","stuff","west","open patio door","closed wooden door","east","thing","patio door","wooden door","one","patio chair","bbq","backyard","exit","south","room","textworld"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you are in a backyard","an ordinary one","you can see a patio table","the patio table appears to be empty","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you make out a patio chair","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","you scan the room , seeing a bbq","there is a closed wooden door leading south","there is an open patio door leading west","there is an exit to the east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou are in a backyard.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is a closed patio door leading east. There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door","door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open patio door"],"text":"You open patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open plain door","directions":null,"entities":["door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open plain door"],"text":"You open plain door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a backyard . an ordinary one . you can see a patio table . the patio table appears to be empty . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . you make out a patio chair . but the thing is empty , unfortunately . you scan the room , seeing a bbq . there is a closed wooden door leading south . there is an open patio door leading west . there is an exit to the east","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["ordinary one","everything","patio table","stuff","west","open patio door","closed wooden door","east","thing","patio door","wooden door","one","patio chair","bbq","backyard","exit","south","room","textworld"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you are in a backyard","an ordinary one","you can see a patio table","the patio table appears to be empty","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","you make out a patio chair","but the thing is empty , unfortunately","you scan the room , seeing a bbq","there is a closed wooden door leading south","there is an open patio door leading west","there is an exit to the east"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou are in a backyard.
