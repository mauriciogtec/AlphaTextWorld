The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a sliced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a carrot, a red onion, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop, a cilantro and a black pepper. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a sliced banana, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . yellow bell pepper . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","slice","yellow bell","reading","meal","yellow bell pepper","banana","copy","modern approach","rd ed","bell pepper","prepare meal","tasty meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","yellow bell pepper","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . yellow bell pepper . directions . slice the banana . roast the banana . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","slice","yellow bell","reading","meal","yellow bell pepper","banana","copy","modern approach","rd ed","bell pepper","prepare meal","tasty meal","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","yellow bell pepper","directions","slice the banana","roast the banana","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  roast the banana\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the banana from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["counter","score","banana","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the banana from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the banana from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","yellow bell pepper","bell pepper"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper"],"text":"The recipe requires a sliced fried yellow bell pepper.\n"},"level":6,"mainbranch":true}]
