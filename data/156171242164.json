A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou see a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a white onion. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a closed oven. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west.
