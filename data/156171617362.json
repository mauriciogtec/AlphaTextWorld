\\$$$$$$$ \n\nYou are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red apple and a white onion. You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, in the room. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm.
