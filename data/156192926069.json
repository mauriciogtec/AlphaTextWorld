Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual one. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. You see a chopped red hot pepper, a sliced banana, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one
