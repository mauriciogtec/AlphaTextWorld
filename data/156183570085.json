A standard kind of place.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. You make out a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You can see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you can make out a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.
