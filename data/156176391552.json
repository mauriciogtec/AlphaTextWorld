You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine banana","examine carrot","examine chicken wing","examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine

The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . red potato . directions . slice the banana . grill the banana . chop the block of cheese . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","slice","recipe","dice","cheese","approach","modern approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","block","copy","rd ed","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","red potato","directions","slice the banana","grill the banana","chop the block of cheese","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  grill the banana\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin looking for stuff . you can make out a patio table . make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on . the patio table is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you bend down to tie your shoe . when you stand up , you notice a patio chair . now why would someone leave that there . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is an open patio door leading east . there is an open wooden door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","shoe","open patio door","open wooden door","east","someone","aw","entranceway","note","stuff","backyard","thing hasnt","anything","closed bbq","patio door","bbq","wooden door","patio table","patio chair"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin looking for stuff","you can make out a patio table","make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on","the patio table is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you bend down to tie your shoe","when you stand up , you notice a patio chair","now why would someone leave that there","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is an open patio door leading east","there is an open wooden door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . red potato . directions . slice the banana . grill the banana . chop the block of cheese . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","slice","recipe","dice","cheese","approach","modern approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","block","copy","rd ed","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","red potato","directions","slice the banana","grill the banana","chop the block of cheese","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  grill the banana\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin looking for stuff . you can make out a patio table . make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on . the patio table is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you bend down to tie your shoe . when you stand up , you notice a patio chair . now why would someone leave that there . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is an open patio door leading east . there is an open wooden door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","shoe","open patio door","open wooden door","east","someone","aw","entranceway","note","stuff","backyard","thing hasnt","anything","closed bbq","patio door","bbq","wooden door","patio table","patio chair"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin looking for stuff","you can make out a patio table","make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on","the patio table is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you bend down to tie your shoe","when you stand up , you notice a patio chair","now why would someone leave that there","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is an open patio door leading east","there is an open wooden door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . red potato . directions . slice the banana . grill the banana . chop the block of cheese . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","slice","recipe","dice","cheese","approach","modern approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","block","copy","rd ed","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","red potato","directions","slice the banana","grill the banana","chop the block of cheese","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  grill the banana\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin looking for stuff . you can make out a patio table . make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on . the patio table is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you bend down to tie your shoe . when you stand up , you notice a patio chair . now why would someone leave that there . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is an open patio door leading east . there is an open wooden door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","shoe","open patio door","open wooden door","east","someone","aw","entranceway","note","stuff","backyard","thing hasnt","anything","closed bbq","patio door","bbq","wooden door","patio table","patio chair"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin looking for stuff","you can make out a patio table","make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on","the patio table is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you bend down to tie your shoe","when you stand up , you notice a patio chair","now why would someone leave that there","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is an open patio door leading east","there is an open wooden door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . red potato . directions . slice the banana . grill the banana . chop the block of cheese . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","slice","recipe","dice","cheese","approach","modern approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","block","copy","rd ed","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","red potato","directions","slice the banana","grill the banana","chop the block of cheese","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  grill the banana\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin looking for stuff . you can make out a patio table . make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on . the patio table is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you bend down to tie your shoe . when you stand up , you notice a patio chair . now why would someone leave that there . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is an open patio door leading east . there is an open wooden door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","shoe","open patio door","open wooden door","east","someone","aw","entranceway","note","stuff","backyard","thing hasnt","anything","closed bbq","patio door","bbq","wooden door","patio table","patio chair"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin looking for stuff","you can make out a patio table","make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on","the patio table is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you bend down to tie your shoe","when you stand up , you notice a patio chair","now why would someone leave that there","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is an open patio door leading east","there is an open wooden door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . red potato . directions . slice the banana . grill the banana . chop the block of cheese . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","slice","recipe","dice","cheese","approach","modern approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","block","copy","rd ed","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","red potato","directions","slice the banana","grill the banana","chop the block of cheese","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  grill the banana\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin looking for stuff . you can make out a patio table . make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on . the patio table is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you bend down to tie your shoe . when you stand up , you notice a patio chair . now why would someone leave that there . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is an open patio door leading east . there is an open wooden door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","shoe","open patio door","open wooden door","east","someone","aw","entranceway","note","stuff","backyard","thing hasnt","anything","closed bbq","patio door","bbq","wooden door","patio table","patio chair"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin looking for stuff","you can make out a patio table","make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on","the patio table is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you bend down to tie your shoe","when you stand up , you notice a patio chair","now why would someone leave that there","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is an open patio door leading east","there is an open wooden door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . red potato . directions . slice the banana . grill the banana . chop the block of cheese . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","slice","recipe","dice","cheese","approach","modern approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","block","copy","rd ed","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","red potato","directions","slice the banana","grill the banana","chop the block of cheese","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  grill the banana\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin looking for stuff . you can make out a patio table . make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on . the patio table is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you bend down to tie your shoe . when you stand up , you notice a patio chair . now why would someone leave that there . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is an open patio door leading east . there is an open wooden door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","shoe","open patio door","open wooden door","east","someone","aw","entranceway","note","stuff","backyard","thing hasnt","anything","closed bbq","patio door","bbq","wooden door","patio table","patio chair"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin looking for stuff","you can make out a patio table","make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on","the patio table is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you bend down to tie your shoe","when you stand up , you notice a patio chair","now why would someone leave that there","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is an open patio door leading east","there is an open wooden door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.\n\nAs if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped block of cheese, a raw chicken wing and a carrot. You scan the room, seeing an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a counter. You see a diced raw red potato, a sliced banana, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . block of cheese . red potato . directions . slice the banana . grill the banana . chop the block of cheese . dice the red potato . roast the red potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["banana","slice","recipe","dice","cheese","approach","modern approach","meal","reading","tasty meal","prepare meal","block","copy","rd ed","potato","red potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","block of cheese","red potato","directions","slice the banana","grill the banana","chop the block of cheese","dice the red potato","roast the red potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  block of cheese\n  red potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  grill the banana\n  chop the block of cheese\n  dice the red potato\n  roast the red potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a backyard . you begin looking for stuff . you can make out a patio table . make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on . the patio table is stylish . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . you bend down to tie your shoe . when you stand up , you notice a patio chair . now why would someone leave that there . but the thing hasnt got anything on it . aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it . you make out a closed bbq . there is an open patio door leading east . there is an open wooden door leading south . you dont like doors . why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["south","shoe","open patio door","open wooden door","east","someone","aw","entranceway","note","stuff","backyard","thing hasnt","anything","closed bbq","patio door","bbq","wooden door","patio table","patio chair"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["youve entered a backyard","you begin looking for stuff","you can make out a patio table","make a note of this , you might have to put stuff on or in it later on","the patio table is stylish","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","you bend down to tie your shoe","when you stand up , you notice a patio chair","now why would someone leave that there","but the thing hasnt got anything on it","aw , here you were , all excited for there to be things on it","you make out a closed bbq","there is an open patio door leading east","there is an open wooden door leading south","you dont like doors","why not try going west , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou've entered a backyard.
