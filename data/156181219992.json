Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a diced cilantro , a yellow bell pepper , an orange bell pepper and a white onion","directions":null,"entities":["bell
