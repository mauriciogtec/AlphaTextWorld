The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","cilantro","raw chicken wing","pepper","bell pepper","block","chicken leg","raw chicken leg","yellow bell pepper","raw yellow potato","black pepper","cheese","fridge","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg, a raw yellow potato, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . chicken wing . red onion . yellow bell pepper . directions . grill the chicken wing . dice the red onion . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","prepare meal","modern approach","approach","rd ed","recipe","tasty meal","chicken wing","red onion","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","meal","reading","slice","copy","onion","dice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","chicken wing","red onion","yellow bell pepper","directions","grill the chicken wing","dice the red onion","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  chicken wing\n  red onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  grill the chicken wing\n  dice the red onion\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a backyard . a standard kind of place . lets see whats in here . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table . the patio table is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience . you can see a bbq . there is an open sliding patio door leading south . there is a closed wooden door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["thing","empty patio chair","entranceway","sliding patio door","wooden door","backyard","patio chair","patio table","west","standard kind","discovery doesnt","kind","textworld","everything","textworld experience","open sliding patio door","bbq","closed wooden door","place","stuff","south","nothing","look","mind","oh"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you arrive in a backyard","a standard kind of place","lets see whats in here","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table","the patio table is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience","you can see a bbq","there is an open sliding patio door leading south","there is a closed wooden door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou arrive in a backyard.

Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","cilantro","raw chicken wing","pepper","bell pepper","block","chicken leg","raw chicken leg","yellow bell pepper","raw yellow potato","black pepper","cheese","fridge","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg, a raw yellow potato, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . chicken wing . red onion . yellow bell pepper . directions . grill the chicken wing . dice the red onion . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","prepare meal","modern approach","approach","rd ed","recipe","tasty meal","chicken wing","red onion","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","meal","reading","slice","copy","onion","dice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","chicken wing","red onion","yellow bell pepper","directions","grill the chicken wing","dice the red onion","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  chicken wing\n  red onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  grill the chicken wing\n  dice the red onion\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a backyard . a standard kind of place . lets see whats in here . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table . the patio table is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience . you can see a bbq . there is an open sliding patio door leading south . there is a closed wooden door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["thing","empty patio chair","entranceway","sliding patio door","wooden door","backyard","patio chair","patio table","west","standard kind","discovery doesnt","kind","textworld","everything","textworld experience","open sliding patio door","bbq","closed wooden door","place","stuff","south","nothing","look","mind","oh"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you arrive in a backyard","a standard kind of place","lets see whats in here","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table","the patio table is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience","you can see a bbq","there is an open sliding patio door leading south","there is a closed wooden door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou arrive in a backyard.

The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","cilantro","raw chicken wing","pepper","bell pepper","block","chicken leg","raw chicken leg","yellow bell pepper","raw yellow potato","black pepper","cheese","fridge","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg, a raw yellow potato, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . chicken wing . red onion . yellow bell pepper . directions . grill the chicken wing . dice the red onion . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","prepare meal","modern approach","approach","rd ed","recipe","tasty meal","chicken wing","red onion","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","meal","reading","slice","copy","onion","dice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","chicken wing","red onion","yellow bell pepper","directions","grill the chicken wing","dice the red onion","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  chicken wing\n  red onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  grill the chicken wing\n  dice the red onion\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a backyard . a standard kind of place . lets see whats in here . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table . the patio table is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience . you can see a bbq . there is an open sliding patio door leading south . there is a closed wooden door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["thing","empty patio chair","entranceway","sliding patio door","wooden door","backyard","patio chair","patio table","west","standard kind","discovery doesnt","kind","textworld","everything","textworld experience","open sliding patio door","bbq","closed wooden door","place","stuff","south","nothing","look","mind","oh"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you arrive in a backyard","a standard kind of place","lets see whats in here","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table","the patio table is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience","you can see a bbq","there is an open sliding patio door leading south","there is a closed wooden door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou arrive in a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","cilantro","raw chicken wing","pepper","bell pepper","block","chicken leg","raw chicken leg","yellow bell pepper","raw yellow potato","black pepper","cheese","fridge","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg, a raw yellow potato, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . chicken wing . red onion . yellow bell pepper . directions . grill the chicken wing . dice the red onion . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","prepare meal","modern approach","approach","rd ed","recipe","tasty meal","chicken wing","red onion","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","meal","reading","slice","copy","onion","dice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","chicken wing","red onion","yellow bell pepper","directions","grill the chicken wing","dice the red onion","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  chicken wing\n  red onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  grill the chicken wing\n  dice the red onion\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a backyard . a standard kind of place . lets see whats in here . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table . the patio table is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience . you can see a bbq . there is an open sliding patio door leading south . there is a closed wooden door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["thing","empty patio chair","entranceway","sliding patio door","wooden door","backyard","patio chair","patio table","west","standard kind","discovery doesnt","kind","textworld","everything","textworld experience","open sliding patio door","bbq","closed wooden door","place","stuff","south","nothing","look","mind","oh"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you arrive in a backyard","a standard kind of place","lets see whats in here","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table","the patio table is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience","you can see a bbq","there is an open sliding patio door leading south","there is a closed wooden door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou arrive in a backyard.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou're now in the kitchen.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. You can make out a closed oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is a closed sliding patio door leading north. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open sliding patio door","directions":null,"entities":["patio door"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open sliding patio door"],"text":"You open sliding patio door.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper","directions":null,"entities":["chicken wing","cilantro","raw chicken wing","pepper","bell pepper","block","chicken leg","raw chicken leg","yellow bell pepper","raw yellow potato","black pepper","cheese","fridge","yellow potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a raw chicken wing , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw chicken leg , a raw yellow potato , a cilantro and a black pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a raw chicken wing, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw chicken leg, a raw yellow potato, a cilantro and a black pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . chicken wing . red onion . yellow bell pepper . directions . grill the chicken wing . dice the red onion . slice the yellow bell pepper . fry the yellow bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["yellow bell","prepare meal","modern approach","approach","rd ed","recipe","tasty meal","chicken wing","red onion","bell pepper","yellow bell pepper","meal","reading","slice","copy","onion","dice"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","chicken wing","red onion","yellow bell pepper","directions","grill the chicken wing","dice the red onion","slice the yellow bell pepper","fry the yellow bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  chicken wing\n  red onion\n  yellow bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  grill the chicken wing\n  dice the red onion\n  slice the yellow bell pepper\n  fry the yellow bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you arrive in a backyard . a standard kind of place . lets see whats in here . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table . the patio table is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it . look out . its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair . the patio chair is stylish . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience . you can see a bbq . there is an open sliding patio door leading south . there is a closed wooden door leading west . you dont like doors . why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["thing","empty patio chair","entranceway","sliding patio door","wooden door","backyard","patio chair","patio table","west","standard kind","discovery doesnt","kind","textworld","everything","textworld experience","open sliding patio door","bbq","closed wooden door","place","stuff","south","nothing","look","mind","oh"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["you arrive in a backyard","a standard kind of place","lets see whats in here","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio table","the patio table is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","what , you think everything in textworld should have stuff on it","look out","its a - oh , never mind , its just a patio chair","the patio chair is stylish","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","hopefully , this discovery doesnt ruin your textworld experience","you can see a bbq","there is an open sliding patio door leading south","there is a closed wooden door leading west","you dont like doors","why not try going east , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nYou arrive in a backyard.
