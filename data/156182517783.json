But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
