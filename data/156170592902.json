You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh!

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh!

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou scan the room, seeing a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh!

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","modern approach","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","orange bell","approach","flour","water","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","north","corridor","door","south"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","modern approach","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","orange bell","approach","flour","water","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","north","corridor","door","south"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","modern approach","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","orange bell","approach","flour","water","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","north","corridor","door","south"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou scan the room, seeing a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","modern approach","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","orange bell","approach","flour","water","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","north","corridor","door","south"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou scan the room, seeing a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","modern approach","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","orange bell","approach","flour","water","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","north","corridor","door","south"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call \"looking.\"\n\nYou scan the room, seeing a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . flour . orange bell pepper . water . directions . dice the orange bell pepper . roast the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","reading","modern approach","tasty meal","prepare meal","copy","meal","orange bell","approach","flour","water","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","flour","orange bell pepper","water","directions","dice the orange bell pepper","roast the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  flour\n  orange bell pepper\n  water\n\nDirections:\n  dice the orange bell pepper\n  roast the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"well , here we are in the corridor . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the north . there is an exit to the south","directions":["north","south","east"],"entities":["exit","north","corridor","door","south"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["well , here we are in the corridor","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the north","there is an exit to the south"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nWell, here we are in the corridor.\n\n\n\nYou need an exit without a door?

You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh!

You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh!

You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh!
