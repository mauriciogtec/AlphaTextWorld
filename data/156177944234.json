This is some kind of kitchen, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.\n\nYou see an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a counter. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a diced cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["diced cilantro","cilantro","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a diced cilantro"],"text":"The recipe requires a diced cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the knife from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["knife","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the knife from the counter"],"text":"You take the knife from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you dice the cilantro . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","cilantro","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you dice the cilantro","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You dice the cilantro.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","point","inventory"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":4,"mainbranch":true}]
