You begin to take stock of what's here.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a parsley, a roasted white onion, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a block of cheese. You see a closed oven in the room. You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a roasted red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a banana, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors?
