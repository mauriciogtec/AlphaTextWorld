The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a white onion and some water. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell

The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a white onion and some water. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell

The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a white onion and some water. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell

The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a white onion and some water. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell

The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a white onion and some water. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell

The fridge contains a diced yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, an orange bell pepper, a white onion and some water. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red apple and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},"level":0,"mainbranch":true},{"cmdlist":["examine cookbook","examine counter","examine fridge","examine knife","examine orange bell
