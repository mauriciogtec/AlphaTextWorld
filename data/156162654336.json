Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. You see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove.
