Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge, so there's that. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a counter. You see a diced raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a block of cheese , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a raw pork chop , a cilantro and some
