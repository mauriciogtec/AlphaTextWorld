Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese ,

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nIf you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nYou bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw pork chop and a cilantro","directions":null,"entities":["sliced carrot","bell pepper","cheese","block","white onion","chopped white onion","carrot","raw pork chop","pork chop","red onion","fridge","cilantro","water","yellow bell pepper","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a sliced carrot , some water , a chopped white onion , a red onion , a yellow bell pepper , a block of cheese , a raw pork chop and a cilantro"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a sliced carrot, some water, a chopped white onion, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a cilantro.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . water . white onion . directions . slice the carrot . fry the carrot . chop the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["onion","prepare meal","tasty meal","white onion","copy","carrot","slice","meal","recipe","rd ed","modern approach","water","reading","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","water","white onion","directions","slice the carrot","fry the carrot","chop the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  water\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  chop the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . water . white onion . directions . slice the carrot . fry the carrot . chop the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["onion","prepare meal","tasty meal","white onion","copy","carrot","slice","meal","recipe","rd ed","modern approach","water","reading","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","water","white onion","directions","slice the carrot","fry the carrot","chop the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n  water\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the carrot\n  fry the carrot\n  chop the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the water from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","fridge","water"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the water from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the water from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","fridge","score","point","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the white onion from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["white onion","fridge","score","point","onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the white onion from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the white onion from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
