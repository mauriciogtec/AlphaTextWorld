You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.\n\nYou make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion and a block of cheese. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You can see a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a table in a room. You can make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced roasted red potato, a chopped fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
