The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a red hot pepper and a raw yellow potato. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
