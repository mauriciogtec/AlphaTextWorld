Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have come into the most usual of all possible kitchens.\n\nYou can see a closed fridge. You see a closed oven right there by you. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a diced fried yellow potato, a sliced banana, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . banana . yellow potato . directions . slice the banana . dice the yellow potato . fry the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["tasty meal","modern approach","slice","yellow potato","meal","prepare meal","banana","rd ed","copy","recipe","reading","potato","approach"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","banana","yellow potato","directions","slice the banana","dice the yellow potato","fry the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  banana\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the banana\n  dice the yellow potato\n  fry the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow potato from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","counter","yellow potato","point","potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow potato from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the yellow potato from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper","directions":null,"entities":["orange bell","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing an orange bell pepper"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing an orange bell pepper.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter","directions":null,"entities":["counter","yellow bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the yellow bell pepper from the counter"],"text":"You take the yellow bell pepper from the counter.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the counter is stable . on the counter are a sliced banana , a raw purple potato , a cookbook and a knife","directions":null,"entities":["counter","sliced banana","banana","knife","raw purple potato","cookbook","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is stable","on the counter are a sliced banana , a raw purple potato , a cookbook and a knife"],"text":"The counter is stable.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife.\n\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the counter is stable . on the counter are a sliced banana , a raw purple potato , a cookbook and a knife","directions":null,"entities":["counter","sliced banana","banana","knife","raw purple potato","cookbook","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the counter is stable","on the counter are a sliced banana , a raw purple potato , a cookbook and a knife"],"text":"The counter is stable.\n\nOn the counter are a sliced banana, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife.\n\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
