A typical kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou make out an opened fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a closed oven close by. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading south. There is an open screen door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . directions . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","prepare meal","copy","reading","tasty meal","meal","modern approach","recipe","carrot","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","directions","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n\nDirections:\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . carrot . directions . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["approach","prepare meal","copy","reading","tasty meal","meal","modern approach","recipe","carrot","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","carrot","directions","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  carrot\n\nDirections:\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"adding the meal to your inventory . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","meal","inventory","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["adding the meal to your inventory","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"Adding the meal to your inventory.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
