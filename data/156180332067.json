The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional.

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?\n\nLook over there! a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a carrot, a diced roasted red onion, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. You see an oven. You can see a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all
