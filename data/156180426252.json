You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You make out an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","tasty meal","copy","modern approach","recipe","prepare meal","meal","approach","rd ed","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . you can barely contain your excitement . there is a closed screen door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["door","excitement","closed screen door","corridor","west","screen door","exit","south","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","you can barely contain your excitement","there is a closed screen door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.

You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see a closed fridge. You make out an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.\n\nThere is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge","directions":null,"entities":["fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge"],"text":"You open the fridge.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . orange bell pepper . directions . chop the orange bell pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","tasty meal","copy","modern approach","recipe","prepare meal","meal","approach","rd ed","orange bell"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","orange bell pepper","directions","chop the orange bell pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  orange bell pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the orange bell pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"youve entered a corridor . you can barely contain your excitement . there is a closed screen door leading south . you need an exit without a door . you should try going east . there is an exit to the west . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["door","excitement","closed screen door","corridor","west","screen door","exit","south","dont worry"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["youve entered a corridor","you can barely contain your excitement","there is a closed screen door leading south","you need an exit without a door","you should try going east","there is an exit to the west","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou've entered a corridor.
