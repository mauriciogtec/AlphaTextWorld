The fridge contains a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a red onion, a cilantro and a parsley. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nYou hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a block of cheese, an orange bell pepper, a red onion, a cilantro and a parsley. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a banana and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . yellow potato . directions . slice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","modern approach","recipe","meal","tasty meal","slice","potato","prepare meal","rd ed","approach","yellow potato","copy","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","yellow potato","directions","slice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . purple potato . yellow potato . directions . slice the purple potato . fry the purple potato . chop the yellow potato . roast the yellow potato . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["purple potato","modern approach","recipe","meal","tasty meal","slice","potato","prepare meal","rd ed","approach","yellow potato","copy","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","purple potato","yellow potato","directions","slice the purple potato","fry the purple potato","chop the yellow potato","roast the yellow potato","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  purple potato\n  yellow potato\n\nDirections:\n  slice the purple potato\n  fry the purple potato\n  chop the yellow potato\n  roast the yellow potato\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you fried the purple potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the purple potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the purple potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you fried the purple potato . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","point","purple potato"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you fried the purple potato","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You fried the purple potato.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":3,"mainbranch":true}]
