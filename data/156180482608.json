The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.\n\nYou see an opened conventional looking fridge in the room. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can see a closed oven here. You can see a table. But the thing is empty. You scan the room, seeing a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading east. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"of every backyard you could have sauntered into , you had to come round a normal one . you can make out a patio table . the patio table is stylish . but there isnt a thing on it . you can make out a patio chair . however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it . you see a closed bbq . there is an open wooden door leading south . there is an open screen door leading west . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["backyard","empty patio chair","closed bbq","thing","bbq","open wooden door","open screen door","west","exit","screen door","door","patio table","south","dont worry","east","wooden door","patio chair","nothing"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"backyard","sentences":["of every backyard you could have sauntered into , you had to come round a normal one","you can make out a patio table","the patio table is stylish","but there isnt a thing on it","you can make out a patio chair","however , the patio chair , like an empty patio chair , has nothing on it","you see a closed bbq","there is an open wooden door leading south","there is an open screen door leading west","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door"],"text":"\n-= Backyard =-\nOf every backyard you could have sauntered into, you had to come round a normal one.\n\nYou can make out a patio table.
