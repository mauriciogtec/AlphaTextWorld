Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge contains a cilantro, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can see a closed oven. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried banana. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge contains a cilantro, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can see a closed oven. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried banana. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge contains a cilantro, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can see a closed oven. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried banana. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.\n\nYou see an open fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge contains a cilantro, an orange bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a parsley and some water. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can see a closed oven. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried banana. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south.
