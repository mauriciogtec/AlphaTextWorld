On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some water","directions":null,"entities":["fridge","chopped carrot","block","carrot","chopped block","white onion","cheese","water","onion","red onion"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a chopped block of cheese, a chopped carrot, a white onion, a red onion and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . roast the block of cheese . chop the carrot . chop the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","modern approach","red hot pepper","meal","pepper","copy","tasty meal","approach","rd ed","block","carrot","chop","prepare meal","cheese","hot pepper","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","roast the block of cheese","chop the carrot","chop the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  roast the block of cheese\n  chop the carrot\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . carrot . red hot pepper . directions . chop the block of cheese . roast the block of cheese . chop the carrot . chop the red hot pepper . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","modern approach","red hot pepper","meal","pepper","copy","tasty meal","approach","rd ed","block","carrot","chop","prepare meal","cheese","hot pepper","reading"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","carrot","red hot pepper","directions","chop the block of cheese","roast the block of cheese","chop the carrot","chop the red hot pepper","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n  carrot\n  red hot pepper\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  roast the block of cheese\n  chop the carrot\n  chop the red hot pepper\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the red hot pepper from the counter . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red hot pepper","score","point","pepper","hot pepper","counter"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the red hot pepper from the counter","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the red hot pepper from the counter.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","carrot","point","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you take the carrot from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["score","carrot","point","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the carrot from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the carrot from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
