\n\nYou are hungry!

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a carrot and a raw chicken wing. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.
