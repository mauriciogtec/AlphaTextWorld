Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've entered a kitchen.\n\nYou can see an open fridge, which looks conventional, in the room. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. Look over there! a table. On the table you make out a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly furious with your TextWorld experience.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the red apple . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red apple","score","apple","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red apple","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the red apple.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"you roasted the red apple . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["red apple","score","apple","point"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you roasted the red apple","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You roasted the red apple.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},"level":1,"mainbranch":true}]
