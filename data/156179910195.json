Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a raw pork chop and some water. You see a closed oven in the room. You make out a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You swear loudly. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried purple potato, a roasted banana, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted yellow bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper, a raw pork chop and some water. You see a closed oven in the room. You make out a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You swear loudly. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried purple potato, a roasted banana, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions
