That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.\n\nYou can see an open fridge nearby. The fridge contains a parsley. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. You see a red apple, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove.
