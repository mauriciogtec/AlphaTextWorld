Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou've just sauntered into a kitchen.\n\nAn open fridge is right there by you. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a diced roasted red potato, a sliced roasted red hot pepper, a sliced fried banana, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
