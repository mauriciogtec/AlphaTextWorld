Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou see an open fridge close by. The fridge contains some water, a chopped white onion and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a black pepper and a knife. You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the west.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"useful for roasting things","directions":null,"entities":[],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["useful for roasting things"],"text":"Useful for roasting things.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the raw pork chop looks delicious","directions":null,"entities":["pork chop","raw pork chop"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the raw pork chop looks delicious"],"text":"The raw pork chop looks delicious.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . red hot pepper . water . white onion . directions . slice the red hot pepper . fry the red hot pepper . chop the white onion . roast the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["reading","meal","water","slice","hot pepper","onion","approach","recipe","tasty meal","pepper","red hot pepper","modern approach","white onion","prepare meal","copy","rd ed"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","red hot pepper","water","white onion","directions","slice the red hot pepper","fry the red hot pepper","chop the white onion","roast the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  red hot pepper\n  water\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  slice the red hot pepper\n  fry the red hot pepper\n  chop the white onion\n  roast the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you are in a corridor . a standard kind of place . there is an exit to the east . dont worry , there is no door . you need an exit without a door . you should try going south . there is an exit to the west","directions":["south","west","east"],"entities":["dont worry","door","exit","standard kind","east","kind","west","place","corridor"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"corridor","sentences":["you are in a corridor","a standard kind of place","there is an exit to the east","dont worry , there is no door","you need an exit without a door","you should try going south","there is an exit to the west"],"text":"\n-= Corridor =-\nYou are in a corridor.
