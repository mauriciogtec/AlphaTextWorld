You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. On the counter you make out a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to
