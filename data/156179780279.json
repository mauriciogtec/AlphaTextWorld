No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou have entered a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen.\n\nYou can make out an open fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
