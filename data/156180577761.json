Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.\n\nYou can see an open fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
