On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a closed fridge. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a knife on the table. Huh, weird. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a banana and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some water","directions":null,"entities":["red onion","parsley","water","cilantro","orange bell pepper","onion","white onion","fridge"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the fridge , revealing a cilantro , a white onion , a red onion , an orange bell pepper , a parsley and some water"],"text":"You open the fridge, revealing a cilantro, a white onion, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a parsley and some water.\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . white onion . directions . dice the cilantro . chop the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["meal","rd ed","modern approach","tasty meal","recipe","reading","approach","prepare meal","cilantro","onion","white onion","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","white onion","directions","dice the cilantro","chop the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the cilantro\n  chop the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . cilantro . white onion . directions . dice the cilantro . chop the white onion . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["meal","rd ed","modern approach","tasty meal","recipe","reading","approach","prepare meal","cilantro","onion","white onion","copy"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","cilantro","white onion","directions","dice the cilantro","chop the white onion","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  cilantro\n  white onion\n\nDirections:\n  dice the cilantro\n  chop the white onion\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you take the cilantro from the fridge . your score has just gone up by one point","directions":null,"entities":["point","score","fridge","cilantro"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you take the cilantro from the fridge","your score has just gone up by one point"],"text":"You take the cilantro from the fridge.\n\n\nYour score has just gone up by one point.\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","chopped white onion","white onion","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped white onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped white onion.\n"}],"feedback_meta":{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a chopped white onion","directions":null,"entities":["onion","chopped white onion","white onion","recipe"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["the recipe requires a chopped white onion"],"text":"The recipe requires a chopped white onion.\n"},"level":5,"mainbranch":true}]
