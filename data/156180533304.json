Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. A closed oven, which looks conventional, is here. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Oh, great. Here's a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal . ingredients . block of cheese . directions . chop the block of cheese . roast the block of cheese . prepare meal","directions":null,"entities":["modern approach","rd ed","block","prepare meal","reading","approach","recipe","tasty meal","meal","copy","cheese"],"is_location":null,"is_valid":true,"location":null,"sentences":["you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed","and start reading","recipe","gather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal","ingredients","block of cheese","directions","chop the block of cheese","roast the block of cheese","prepare meal"],"text":"You open the copy of \"Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)\" and start reading:\n\nRecipe #1\n---------\nGather all following ingredients and follow the directions to prepare this tasty meal.\n\nIngredients:\n  block of cheese\n\nDirections:\n  chop the block of cheese\n  roast the block of cheese\n  prepare meal\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"a rusty signboard tells you that you are now in the livingroom . you can see a sofa . however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it . there is an exit to the north . dont worry , there is no door . you dont like doors . why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one","directions":["north","south"],"entities":["north","nothing","entranceway","signboard","rusty signboard","dont worry","empty sofa","livingroom","exit","sofa","door"],"is_location":true,"is_valid":true,"location":"livingroom","sentences":["a rusty signboard tells you that you are now in the livingroom","you can see a sofa","however , the sofa , like an empty sofa , has nothing on it","there is an exit to the north","dont worry , there is no door","you dont like doors","why not try going south , that entranceway is not blocked by one"],"text":"\n-= Livingroom =-\nA rusty signboard tells you that you are now in the livingroom.\n\nYou can see a sofa.
