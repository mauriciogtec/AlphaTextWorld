Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a banana and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well\n\nThere is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
