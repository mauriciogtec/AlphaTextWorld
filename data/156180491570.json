Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nYou arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the fridge , revealing a chopped block of cheese , a chopped carrot , a white onion , a red onion and some

Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove.

Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove.

Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove.

Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove.

Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.\n\nYou see a fridge. You can see an oven. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a chopped red hot pepper, a red apple, a banana and a black pepper. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove.
