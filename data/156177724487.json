Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You can see a table. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","purple potato","roasted purple

Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. You make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, close by. You can see a table. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading east. There is an exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"the recipe requires a roasted purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["recipe","purple potato","roasted purple
