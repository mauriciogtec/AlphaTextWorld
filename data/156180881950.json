The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional.

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the

Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!\n\n-= Kitchen =-\nLook at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.\n\nOh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro, a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a parsley and some water. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a cookbook on the table. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.\n\n\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following ingredients and follow the
