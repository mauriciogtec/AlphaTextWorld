A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following

A typical kind of place.\n\nYou scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. Classic TextWorld. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove! But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open screen door leading south. There is an open plain door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you open the copy of cooking a modern approach 3 rd ed . and start reading . recipe . gather all following
