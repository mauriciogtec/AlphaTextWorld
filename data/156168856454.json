That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple

That is to say, you're in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.\n\nYou can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a cilantro and some water. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty.\n\nThere is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\n\n"},{"clean_text":"you roasted the purple potato","directions":null,"entities":["purple
